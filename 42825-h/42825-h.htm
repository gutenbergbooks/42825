<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>This volume owes its existence principally to the repeated requests
of a number of our fair patrons, and amateur supporters, whose enquiries
and wishes for a practical manual on Floraculture, at last induced
us to prepare a work on the subject. That now offered is given
unaffectedly and simply as a plain and easy treatise on this increasingly
interesting subject. It will at once be perceived that there are no
pretensions to literary claims&mdash;the directions are given in the simplest
manner&mdash;the arrangement made as lucidly as was in our power&mdash;and
the whole is presented with the single wish of its being practically useful.
How far our object has been attained of course our readers must
judge. Nothing has been intentionally concealed; and all that is asserted
is the result of minute observation, close application, and an
extended continuous experience from childhood. We pretend not to
infallibility, and are not so sanguine as to declare our views the most
perfect that can be attained. But we can so far say, that the practice
here recommended has been found very successful.</p>

<p>Some very probably may be disappointed in not having the means
of propagating as clearly delineated as those of culture; but to have
entered into all the minuti&aelig; connected therewith, would have formed
materials for two volumes larger than the present. We might have
described that branch, as it has already been done in works published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
both on this continent and in Europe. In one of the former it is said,
"You may now propagate many kinds (<i>Exotic Plants</i>) by suckers,
cuttings, and layers, which should be duly attended to, particularly
such as are scarce and difficult to be obtained." And the directions
given in one of the most extensive works in Europe on the propagation
of an extensive genus, varied in character and constitution, run thus:
"Cuttings of most kinds will strike root. From the strongest growing
kinds, take off large cuttings at a joint, and plunge them in a pot
of sand under a hand-glass in the bark bed. Of the smaller kinds
take younger kinds, and put them under a bell-glass, also plunged in
heat. The sooner the plants are potted off after they are rooted the
better."</p>

<p>Such instructions to the inexperienced, are imperfect and unavailing,
which, we flatter ourselves, is not the character that will attach to
the present work. We are well aware that there are persons, who, to
show their own superior abilities, may cavil and say that there is nothing
new. To such critics it may be answered, if arranging, simplifying,
digesting, and rendering Floraculture attainable by the humblest capacity,
with useful lists and tables on a plan quite novel, as we believe&mdash;offer
nothing new, it may at least be called an improvement. However,
we submit all to a generous public, to whom we are already
under many obligations.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>In presenting this work, constructed as a monthly calendar, which
is the most simple and easy method to convey the necessary operations
of the year, considerably more labour has been expended, than
was at first expected, to render it as accurate as possible. Some
verbal mistakes may have been overlooked in the botanical names.
Where such occur, the list of names at the end of the volume will
enable the reader to correct them; as well as the accentuation.
For such other errors as may be discovered, the indulgence of the
reader is solicited.</p>

<p>Frequently, in the description of plants, there are Botanical and
English names compounded, in order the more clearly to elucidate
their several parts to those who are not fully acquainted with scientific
terms. The description of the colour of flowers and habits of
plants will be useful to such as are at a great distance from collections,
in enabling them to make selections judiciously.</p>

<p>Those plants described and recommended have all, with a few exceptions,
passed under our own observation, and are generally such
as are most worthy of attention, either for beauty of flower, foliage,
or habit, together with those celebrated in arts and medicine. Many
may possibly have passed unobserved, either from their being very generally
known, or difficult to obtain; but in no case has there been suppression
from selfish motives. Where the words "our collections"
occur, it is meant for those of the country generally, and especially
those immediately in the vicinity of Philadelphia. In all our observations,
no regard has been paid to what has been written by others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
either in the way of depreciation, or of particular appreciation.
Perhaps some other cultivators may differ from us respecting culture
and soil; however this may be, we rest satisfied, as our work is designedly
and professedly given as the result of our own experience,
the plan laid down is our own routine of culture, and the soils are
those which we adopt. We do not say that there is no soil in which
the plants will not grow better, fully aware that every art and profession
is subject to improvement. The table of soils has been constructed
at the expense of much labour, and condensed as much as possible;
to every one that has a single plant it will be found invaluable. Many
are the publications in Europe on Gardening and Floraculture, the
directions in which, when practised in the United States, prove
almost a perfect dead letter. A work adapted to the climate must
be the guide in this country, and not one which is foreign to us in
every respect. On this account a work like the present has been a
desideratum, considering the rapidly increasing and interesting advancement
of the culture of flowers amongst the fair daughters of
our flourishing republic.</p>

<p>To aid them and others seeking information in this instructive and
delightful pursuit&mdash;to enable them to examine more minutely, and
judge more correctly of the qualities, properties, and beauties of
plants&mdash;have been prominent objects in this publication. Here, as
knowledge is increased, the warmer will be the devotion of the delighted
student; and as the mind correspondingly expands, the desire
for further information will keep pace&mdash;advancing constantly in the
development of nature, the mind will participate in the enjoyment,
and become meliorated and purified&mdash;as the study of nature's works
inevitably lead to the contemplation of nature's God, and the result of
the whole prove a harmonious combination of personal gratification and
mental improvement.</p>

<p><i>Jasm&igrave;num</i>, Jasmine. A few species of this genus are
celebrated either for the Green-house or Rooms. <i>J.
odorat&iacute;ssimum</i>, Azorian, has very sweet-scented yellow
flowers, blooming from April to November. <i>J. revol&ugrave;tum</i>
is the earliest flowering one, and of the same colour;
it is apt to grow straggling, and should be close pruned
as soon as done blooming, which will be about June.
<i>J. grandifl&ograve;rum</i> is frequently called Catalonian, and
should be pruned early in spring to make it bloom well,
especially old plants. <i>J. officin&agrave;le</i> is a hardy climbing
plant for arbours, walls, &amp;c. There are several varieties

<h3><i>JANUARY.</i></h3>

<p>At all times be very careful of the temperature of
this department, and more especially at this season of
the year, as a few minutes' neglect might materially
injure many of the delicate plants. The thermometer
ought to range between 58&deg; and 65&deg;. In fine sunshine
days, admit a little air by having some of the top sashes
let down, one, two, or three inches, according to the
weather, and let it always be done from eleven to one
o'clock; but by no means in such a manner as to cause
a draught in the interior of the house, which would be
very prejudicial. Therefore be always cautious during
cold weather, in administering that necessary element
to vegetation, which is so conducive to health.</p>


<h4>OF FIRING AND FUEL.</h4>

<p>The Hot-house ought never to be left entirely to inexperienced
persons, because they are not aware of
what might be the result of inattention even for an hour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Attention to the following observations will obviate
every difficulty. About this season of the year, frost
generally sets in very severe in the middle states. Suppose
the day may have all the clemency of spring, the
night may be directly the reverse. Every precaution
is necessary to guard against extremes. According to
what was said last month, it is understood that the
shutters are put on every night at sundown, and in
severe weather, they must be put on as soon as the sun
goes off the glass. If the shutters are omitted till late
in severe frost, it will so reduce the heat of the house,
that you cannot overcome it by fire until near midnight;
and when done, the fire or fires have been made
more powerful than they ought to be, proving uncongenial
to the plants that are near the flues. The air,
as above directed, having been taken off the house at
one o'clock, as soon as the mercury begins to fall in
the thermometer, kindle the fire, and supposing it is
anthracite coal, in twenty minutes, with a good drawing
furnace, the heat will operate in the house. If a
coal fire, kindled about four o'clock, it will require an
addition about six, and then may be made up again
about nine or ten, which will suffice until morning.
The quantity must be regulated by the weather. If
the fuel is wood, it must be attended to three or four
times during the evening; and when the mornings are
intensely cold, one fire in the morning is requisite.
When there are bad drawing furnaces the fires must
be made much earlier, perhaps by two or three o'clock,
which will be easily observed by the time the fire takes
effect upon the air of the house. The temperature
ought never to be under 55&deg; of Fahrenheit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>


<h4>OF WATERING THE PLANTS.</h4>

<p>To do this judiciously, is so necessary to vegetation,
and so requisite to understand, and yet the knowledge
so difficult to convey to others (being entirely acquired
by practice,) that if the power was in man to impart it
to his fellow-men, he would possess the power of
perfecting a gardener by diction. However, the hints
on this important point of floraculture, will be as clear
and expressive as can at present be elicited. All plants
in this work that are aquatic, shall be specified as
such; and those that are arid shall be duly mentioned.
All others will come in the medium.</p>

<p>All the plants must be looked over every day, and
those watered that appear to be getting dry on the
top. It must be strictly observed not to give water to
any but such as are becoming dry, and let it be given
moderately at this season. Two or three days may perhaps
elapse before it need be repeated. There is not so
much liability to err at present in giving too little, as in
administering too much. Vegetation amongst the stove
or Hot-house plants will soon begin to show, and the soil
will prove uncongenial if it is impregnated with stagnant
moisture. Small plants should always be watered
with a pot, having what is termed a rose upon it. The
surface of the rose, that is, where it is perforated with
small apertures, ought to be level, or a little concave,
which would convey the water more to a centre, and
make neater work, by preventing any water from being
unnecessarily spilt in the house. The size of the pot
will be regulated by the person to suit the conveniences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of the place. Water, when applied either to the roots
or foliage of the plants, should be about the medium
temperature of the house. The cistern, built on the
plan herein recommended, will always give this, and
sometimes more, which can easily be reduced by adding
cold water. Where there are no cisterns, a tank
or barrel might be in the house, in which the water
could stand for one night or more, as is most suitable.
When water is given without being thus aired, it chills
the roots, prevents a luxuriant growth, injures the fresh
and healthful appearance of the foliage, and too frequently
gives to all the plants a sickly hue.</p>


<h4>OF INSECTS, THEIR DESTRUCTION, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>In this department, insects begin to increase by
hundreds, and too frequently their ravages are very
obvious before their progress is arrested. We will
treat of those which are most common, under their respective
heads, with their nature and cure, as far as
has come under our observation.</p>

<p><i>Aphis ros&aelig;</i>, of the natural order of Hemiptera, or
what is commonly known by Green Fly, Green Lice,
&amp;c. infect plants in general, and are particularly destructive
in the Hot-house to <i>Hib&iacute;scus r&ograve;sa-sin&eacute;nsis</i>, <i>Ascl&egrave;pias</i>,
<i>Cr&aacute;ssula cocc&iacute;nea</i>, <i>Alstr&oelig;m&egrave;ria</i>, and many other
plants of a free growing nature. They attack the
young and tender shoots at the point, leaving a dark
filthy appearance on the foliage. Many remedies for
their destruction have been offered to the public by
various writers, each equally secure in his own opinion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Extensive practice alone can show the most easy and
effectual cure. Fumigating with tobacco is decidedly
the most efficacious, and in the power of any to perform.
Take a small circular furnace, made of sheet
iron, diameter at top twelve inches, and at bottom
eight; depth one foot, having a grating in it to reach
within three inches of the bottom, which will leave space
for the air to pass, and where the ashes will fall and be
kept in safety, having a handle like a pail to carry it
with. This, or any thing similar, being ready, put in
it a few embers of ignited charcoal; take it into the
centre of the house, and put on the coals a quantity of
moist tobacco stems. If they attempt to blaze or
flame, sprinkle a little water over them; and as they
consume, continue to add tobacco until the house is
entirely full of smoke, observing always to do it in still,
cloudy weather, or in the evening. If it is windy, the
smoke is carried off without having half the effect,
and requires more tobacco. The house must be
closely shut up. There are several plants whose foliage
is of a soft downy nature, such as <i>Helitr&ograve;piums</i>,
<i>Callac&aacute;rpas</i>, <i>S&aacute;lvias</i>, and many of the <i>Lant&agrave;nas</i>, <i>V&iacute;ncas</i>,
with several others, that cannot stand, without danger,
strong fumigation. These should be put low down in
the house, or under the stage. These fumigations
will have to be repeated frequently, the time for which
will easily be perceived; and, when required, ought not
to be delayed. Several species and varieties of the
same genus, <i>Aphis</i>, can be destroyed in the like manner.</p>

<p><i>Acaris tellurius</i>, or red spider, is caused by a dry at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>mosphere,
and its havoc generally is obvious before it
is arrested. With its proboscis, it wounds the fine capillary
vessels; and if the leaves are fine, they will appear
as if probed with a needle, and yellowish around
the wound. If they have farther progressed in their
destructive work, the leaves will prematurely decay.
On this appearance, turn up the leaf, and you will see
them running about with incredible swiftness. Their
body is of a blood colour, and their feet, eight in
number, light red. When very numerous, they work
thick webs on the under side of the leaf, and frequently
all over it, forming a mass of half dead
plants, decayed leaves, and thousands of spiders.
The most effectual remedy is a thorough syringing
with water, and profusely under the foliage. This
being done every evening, will subdue and eventually
banish them. Had the house been syringed two or
three times per week, these intruders would not have
appeared. It is said by some writers, that watering
only reduces them to a temporary state of inaction,
and will not destroy them. Laying aside the many
prescribed nostrums, we assert that the pure element
is the most effectual cure, as well as the most easy
to be obtained.</p>

<p><i>Thrips</i>, order <i>Hemiptera</i>, are insects so minute as
scarcely to be perceptible to the naked eye. They
generally lurk close to the veins of the leaves of plants,
and frequently attack esculents. When viewed through
a glass, they are seen, when touched, to skip with
great agility. The larva is of a high brown, or reddish
colour. The thrip has four wings, and walks with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
body turned upwards. It frequently attacks the extremities
of tender shoots, or young leaves, which become
shrivelled, brown, and will rub to dust easily between
the thumb and finger. When any leaves or shoots are
perceived to be so, if you do not observe the green fly,
expect the thrips. They may be destroyed by a fumigation
of tobacco, in the same manner as the green fly.
By the simple and expeditious method of fumigation,
these insects and several others may be destroyed effectually
at any time they appear.</p>

<p><i>Cocus hesperidus</i>, or mealy bug, has appeared in the
Hot-houses about Philadelphia within these few years,
and, if not instantly destroyed, increases rapidly. It
is of a white dusty colour, when broken, of a brownish
red, generally covered with down, under which it deposits
its eggs; and they, in a few months, come forth
in great numbers. The cocus generally is of a dormant
nature, but, in warm weather, they may be seen
moving rapidly up the stems of the plants. Fumigating
has no observable effect on these insects; therefore,
as soon as they appear, recourse must be had to
other means. The liquid made from the following receipt,
is death to any of the <i>Cocus</i> tribe: Take two
pounds of strong soap, one pound flour of sulphur, one
pound of leaf tobacco, one and a half ounce of nux vomica,
with a table spoonful of turpentine, which boil in
four gallons of river water to three; then set aside to
cool. When boiling, stir it well with a stick, continuing
to do so until it is reduced as above. In this
liquor immerse the whole plant, drawing it to and fro
gently, that the liquor may penetrate every where.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>This done, lay the plant on its side, until it begin to
dry, then syringe well with clean water, and put it in
its respective station. Where a collection of plants
is free from any insects of the kind, every plant that is
introduced, ought to be minutely scrutinized, that the
unclean may be kept from the clean: the above insect
will feed almost on any plant, but indulges on <i>Cr&aacute;ssulas</i>,
any of the bristly <i>C&aacute;ctus</i>, <i>Gard&egrave;nias</i>, and in fact whatever
is in the way.</p>

<p><i>Cocus&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i>, or brown scaly insect, is frequently
found on many plants, but we never could perceive that
it does any other material injury, than dirtying them.
We have always observed, that it is found in winter to
abound most in those situations which are most excluded
from air; therefore is of less importance than the
other species, which eat and corrode the leaves of tender
plants. A washing with strong soap suds will destroy
them, or the above liquid will do it more effectually.
Tie a piece of sponge on the end of a small
stick, and scrub every leaf, stem, and crevice. Fumigating
destroys the larv&aelig; of this species.</p>

<p><i>Cocus&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i>, or small white scaly insect, which
generally infests <i>Cycas revol&ugrave;ta</i> and <i>circin&agrave;lis</i>, the varieties
of <i>N&egrave;rium ole&aacute;nder</i>, <i>Oleas</i>, and several species of
<i>Acacias</i>, may be destroyed by washing as above with a
sponge, and a strong decoction of tobacco, using the
liquid about the warmth of 100&deg;. Being thus heated,
it irritates the insect, when, by easing itself from its
bed, the fluid passes under it, and causes immediate
death. If it is not thus irritated, it adheres so closely
to the foliage, that it will keep you at defiance. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
under, or dark side of the leaves is its
residence; and we have observed a plant in a house
where there was only light on one side, with the dark
side literally covered, while the light side was clean.
So much for having houses with plenty of light. The
effects of this insect are of a corroding nature, extracting
all the juices from the leaf under it, even straining
to the other side; and where they have got to the
extremity, the foliage is completely yellow, and of a
decayed appearance.</p>

<p><i>Cocus&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i>, or turtle insect. We have never
observed this insect arrive to any extent, but think that
the <i>Datura arborea</i> is most infested with it. It is the
largest of any genus known amongst us, and very
like a turtle in miniature. On lifting it from the wood,
to which it generally adheres, there appear to be hundreds
of eggs under it, but fumigating completely destroys
the larv&aelig;. In our opinion this turtle insect is
no other than the old female of the brown scaly insect,
which swells to a large size before depositing its eggs.
We have frequently observed the insect dead in this
enlarged state, and question if this is the last stage of
its transmigration. The male insect is winged, and
very active in its movements.</p>


<h4>OF SHIFTING PLANTS.</h4>

<p>At this period of the season very little is required to
grow <i>Calceol&agrave;rias</i> to perfection. They require a few
months of the Hot-house, and if the directions given
last month were followed up, some of these will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
advanced a little in growth. The herbaceous kinds,
when grown about one inch high, ought to be divided,
and put into four inch pots, sprinkled gently, and kept
in the shade until they begin to grow; after which, keep
them near the glass, to prevent them from becoming
spindly and drawn. Their farther treatment will be
observed as they require. This is a beautiful genus of
plants, flowering very profusely all summer, and some
of them early in spring.</p>

<p><i>Alstr&oelig;m&egrave;rias</i>, about the beginning or middle of the
month, will have made their appearance above ground.
When shot about one inch, turn them out, and carefully
shake them clear of earth; and if required, divide the
crowns, and put them in as small pots as possible,
taking care not to break any of the strong fleshy roots.
(For Soil, <a href="#TABLE_OF_SOILS">see Table</a>.) To flower these plants well,
they require to be frequently shifted, during their active
stage of growth, which must be duly observed. The
most of the species of this genus will more than repay
the attention, by their abundantly and beautifully spotted
flowers. <i>A. fl&oacute;smart&igrave;na</i>, <i>A. Pelegr&igrave;na</i>, <i>A. pulch&eacute;lla</i>,
and <i>A. atr&oacute;purpurea</i>, are the most splendid. The former
flowers very freely. All natives of South America.</p>

<p>Where bulbous roots, such as <i>Hyacinths</i>, <i>Jonquils</i>,
<i>Narcissus</i>, <i>Ixias</i>, <i>Lachen&agrave;llas</i>, &amp;c. are required to be
early in flower, they may, about the beginning or end
of the month, be put in the front of the Hot-house,
giving very little water until they begin to grow; then
water freely, and tie up the flower stems as they advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>


<h4>OF CLEANSING PLANTS, HOUSE, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>This subject ought to be kept constantly in view.
However correct every thing may be executed, without
that adorning beauty, cleanliness, all will appear
only half done. Therefore let all the dead leaves be
picked off every day, and with dust and other litter
swept out of the house, and when necessary, the
house washed, which will be at least once a week.
That the foliage of the plants may always appear fresh,
syringe them in the evening, twice or three times per
week; (when the weather is very cold, do it in the
morning.) At present this will in a great measure keep
down the insects, and will prove a bane to the red
spider.</p>

<p>A hand engine is certainly the best. Milne's patent
hand engine surpasses any that we have used.
Nevertheless a hand syringe is very effectual. Some
of these engines are powerful, throwing the water
above forty feet. Read's patent of London is excellent.
At the store of D. &amp; C. Landreth, Phila., there is a very
good kind, which answers admirably in small houses.
Tie up neatly with stakes, and threads of Russia mat,
all the straggling growing plants; let the stakes be proportionate
to the plants, and never longer, except they
are climbing sorts. Do not tie the branches in bundles,
but singly and neatly, imitating nature as much as
possible. If any of the plants are affected with the
<i>Cocus</i> insect, let them be cleaned according to the plan
already mentioned, taking particular care also in washing
the stakes to which they had been previously tied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and burning all the old tyings, which contain the larv&aelig;
of the insect in many instances, especially of <i>Cocus hesperidus</i>.
It is premised, when any of these things are
done, that they will be well done, and not half doing,
and always doing. Cleanliness, in every respect, promotes
a pure air, which is congenial to vegetation, and
will, with other attention, always ensure a healthful and
vigorous appearance in the house.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Green-House" id="Green-House">Green-House.</a></h2>


<h3><i>JANUARY.</i></h3>

<p>This compartment requires particular attention, in
order to preserve the plants in good health, and carry
them through this precarious season of the year. A
little air must be admitted at all convenient times. An
hour or two at mid-day will be of the utmost importance
in drying up damp, and clearing off stagnated air,
which is a harbour for every corruption. The top sashes
being let down, or turned a few inches, in mild days (that
is, when it is not high and cutting winds) from ten or
eleven o'clock to two or three, according to the intensity
of the frost, will renovate the interior air of the house,
and harden the plants. When the weather will permit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
let the front sashes be opened about one inch or more.
An assiduous, experienced hand will never omit an opportunity.</p>

<p>With regard to fire heat, the temperature must be
regulated to suit the nature of the plants in a general
sense; so let the mercury, or spirits of wine, of Fahrenheit's
thermometer, be from 34&deg; to 43&deg;; if it begins to
fall, give a little fire heat. No doubt we have seen the
thermometer much lower in the Green-house, than the
above, even as low as 24&deg;, without any immediate injury;
but it was in an extensive collection, where the
most hardy of the plants were selected into one house.
Many boast how little fire they give their Green-house,
and how cold it is kept, not observing the miserable
state of their plants,&mdash;inexperience causing them
to think, that the least fire heat will make them grow,
and would rather look on naked stems than healthy
plants. The above temperature will not, in exotics,
cause premature vegetation, but will cause the plants
to retain the foliage requisite to vegetative nature. A
high temperature is not necessary for the generality of
Green-house plants; on the contrary, it might very
much injure them.</p>


<h4>OF WATERING.</h4>

<p>In this month very little is requisite, and must be
given with great caution. Few plants will require much,
and some hardly any; but all must be attended to, and
have their wants supplied. Some will need it twice,
some once a week, and some in two weeks, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to their shrubby and woody nature. Herbaceous and
deciduous plants will seldom need water. Perhaps,
from the throwing of the foliage, to the commencement
of vegetation, three or four times will be sufficient.
Particular attention should be paid to the state of
health and of growth, in which the plants respectively
are, in the application of water; otherwise much mischief
may be done, and many entirely ruined.</p>

<p>Green-house plants, being now in an absolutely inactive
state, require little more water than merely to
keep the earth about their roots from becoming perfectly
dry, by occasionally applying a very small quantity
at the root; and, if done with a watering pot, as
described under this head in the Hot-house of this
month, very little will be spilt in the house to increase
dampness, which, if it does appear, by any of the leaves
of the plants becoming musty, they must be instantly
picked off; and, if it increases, give a little fire and air.
Succulent plants will not need any water during this
month, unless omitted in December.</p>


<h4>CAMELLIA JAPONICA.</h4>

<p>This magnificent and attractive flower, with all its
splendid varieties, will, about this time, begin to open
its beautiful flowers. But for this admired genus of
plants, our Green-houses, at this season, would be void
of allurement. It is, in this country, subject to mildew
and red spider, and more especially in the city, which
appears to be from the nature of the air. The effects
of mildew on these plants, if not prevented, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
prove fatal; as, from appearance, many have died by
it in our city. If it has reached a great extent, the
leaves are brownish, having the appearance of being
decayed, or scorched with the sun. In taking hold of
the leaf, it feels soft, and altogether seems to have lost
its nutritive substance; and, when the young foliage
expands, it becomes covered with dark brown spots,
and finally very much disfigured; and, when in this
state, it is attacked by red spider, and, ultimately,
death ensues.</p>

<p>If any of the plants are affected as above described,
take a sponge, and wash every leaf minutely with soft
water, and syringe them with water three or four times
a week, which will clean them. All the young foliage
will be healthy, and that which has been affected will
fall off. However, prevention is better than cure; and
if the <i>Camellias</i> are properly syringed every evening
during summer, and once or twice a week during winter,
they will never be subject to the ravages of mildew
or of red spider.</p>

<p>Tie up any of the flowers that are expanded to
stakes, in case of accident; and, in syringing, observe
not to let any water fall on the flowers, as it causes
premature decay, and change of colour.</p>

<p>The mildew first appears like small particles of very
fine flour, around the under edge of the leaves, and
visible to the naked eye; so that, syringing, sponging,
&amp;c. under the leaf is most requisite; but, as the
mildew extends, both sides of the leaves are covered
with these white particles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>


<h4>OF ORANGES, LEMONS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>As there will perhaps be more leisure in the Green-house
this month than in any other during the winter,
it is presumed that there will not be a moment lost.
If any of the trees are infested with insects, these,
being now in their inactive state, may be more easily
destroyed than at any other time. It is the brown
scaly insect that generally infests them. For treatment,
see <i>Hothouse, January</i>. The plant, or tree, after
being washed, before it becomes dry, will require to be
syringed with water, otherwise the dust will adhere to
the glutinous particles of the soap. Set the plant in
an airy situation to dry, in case of damp. There are
several others subject to this insect, such as <i>Myrtles</i>,
<i>Oleas</i>, <i>Oleanders</i>, &amp;c. which treat in the same manner.
Be careful that these trees are not over watered; if
the soil is moist, it is sufficient.</p>


<h4>OF CAPE BULBS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>If there are any out of the ground, it is time that the
whole were potted, such as <i>Lachen&agrave;lia</i>, <i>Wachend&oacute;rfia</i>,
<i>E&ugrave;comis</i>, <i>Ixia</i>, <i>Glad&igrave;olus</i>, with several others. Keep
them in the shade until they begin to grow; then put
them on shelves near the light. Those that are growing
must be kept in front of the house, to prevent
them being weak. <i>Wachend&oacute;rfia</i> has a beautiful large
red tuber root; and, as the new root descends, give it
a pot about six or seven inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>


<h4>OF HYACINTHS AND OTHER BULBOUS ROOTS.</h4>

<p>All these roots must be carefully examined. In
case slugs or snails are preying upon the embryo of
the flower, some of those that are farthest advanced,
may be put for a few weeks in the Hot-house. It will
greatly accelerate their flowering, but they must be
brought out again before the florets expand, and carefully
tied up, leaving room for the increase and extension
of the flower stem. Give them plenty of water,
and if saucers can be placed under them to retain it,
it will be of advantage. Change the water every week
on those that are in glasses, and keep all the growing
bulbs near the light. <i>Narcissus</i>, <i>Jonquils</i>, &amp;c. may be
similarly treated.</p>

<h3><i>JANUARY.</i></h3>


<p>If the covering of the beds of choice bulbs, herbaceous
plants, or tender shrubs, has been neglected last
month, let it be done forthwith. The season is now
precarious, and delays are dangerous. For particular
directions, see <a href="#Page_342"><i>December</i></a>. Any bulbous roots that have
been kept out of the ground, should be planted immediately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
according to directions in <a href="#Page_317"><i>October</i></a>. Some
writers have recommended keeping some of the bulbs
until this month, in order to have a continued succession.
Experience will prove the inefficacy of the
plan, and will satisfactorily show that the difference is
almost imperceptible, while the flowers are very inferior
and much degenerated; and in place of having "a
long continued succession of bloom," there appear,
along with your finest specimens, very imperfect
flowers, calculated to discourage the admirers of these
"gaudy" decoratives of our flower gardens. Whereas
every art employed should be to the advancement and
perfection of nature.</p>


<h4>OF FRAMING, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>The plants and roots that are in frames, should be
protected with straw mats, and the frame surrounded
with litter, or leaves, or what is more advisable, banked
with earth&mdash;the former being a harbour for mice
and other vermin. For full directions, see <a href="#Page_342"><i>December</i></a>.
Under this head the plants, such as <i>Auriculas</i>, <i>Polyanthus</i>,
<i>Daisies</i>, <i>Carnations</i>, <i>Pinks</i>, <i>Gentianellas</i>, <i>Campanula
pyramidalis</i>, <i>Double rocket</i>, <i>Double stock</i>, <i>or Stockgillys</i>,
<i>Double Wall-flower</i>, <i>Anemone</i>, <i>Ranunculus</i>, &amp;c. as previously
enumerated as frame plants, will require very
little water, and be sure to give none while they are in
a frozen state. If snow should cover them, the plants
will keep in a fine state under it, so never remove snow
from covering cold frames, even suppose it should lay
for months,&mdash;nature will operate here herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>All the above plants except <i>Anemone</i> and <i>Ranunculus</i>
are kept in perfection in the Green-house; but where
neither this nor framing can be obtained, they will, in
most winters, keep tolerably, if well covered with litter&mdash;the
roughest from the stable, straw or hay, or such
like, using means to secure it from being blown over
the whole garden.</p>


<h4>OF PRUNING AND PREPARING FOR SPRING.</h4>

<p>It is not advisable to carry on a general pruning in
this month, in whatever state the weather may be.
The severest frosts generally are yet to come, and
too frequently in this operation, what is done now has
to be repeated on the opening of spring, causing at
that time work to a disadvantage; because, if pruning,
when done just now, is accomplished judiciously,
whatever more on the same bush is requisite to be
done in spring, from the effects of frost, will be injudicious.
Hence it is far preferable to delay it until
the frost is over, when all can be done to advantage.</p>

<p>There are, undoubtedly, some shrubs that may be
pruned any time, from the end of November to the first
of March, such as <i>Hib&iacute;scus syr&igrave;acus</i> (<i>Althea</i>), and all its
varieties, except the <i>Double White</i>, which is in some
instances entirely killed by our severe winter, and certainly,
for precaution, would be the better of some simple
protection.</p>

<p>In many seasons, the beginning of this month is
open, and admits of the operation of digging, which if
it is not all done as advised last month, ought not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
be delayed. The fruits of it will appear in the mellowed
state of your soil in spring.</p>

<p>If there is any spare time, straight sticks or stakes
may be prepared for summer. Tie them up in neat
bundles, which will be of great service during the
hurried period of the year. An opportunity of this kind
should always be laid hold of; the beneficial results will
in season be displayed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="ROOMS2" id="ROOMS2"><span class="antiqua">ROOMS.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>JANUARY.</i></h3>


<p>Plants that are kept in rooms generally are such as
require a medium temperature, say 40&deg;. Sitting rooms
or parlours, about this season, are, for the most part,
heated from 55&deg; to 65&deg;, and very seldom has the air any admittance
into these apartments, thus keeping the temperature
from 15&deg; to 25&deg; higher than the nature of the plants
requires, and excluding that fresh air which is requisite
to support a forced vegetative principle. Therefore,
as far as practicable, let the plants be kept in a room
adjoining to one where there is fire heat, and the intervening
door can be opened when desirable. They will
admit sometimes of being as low as 33&deg;.</p>

<p>If they be constantly kept where there is fire, let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
window be opened some inches; two or three time a
day, for a few minutes, thereby making the air of the
apartment more congenial, both for animal and vegetable
nature.</p>


<h4>WATERING, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>There are very few plants killed for want of water,
during winter. All that is necessary is merely to keep
the soil in a moist state, that is, do not let it get so dry
that you can divide the particles of earth, nor so wet
that they could be beat to clay. The frequency of
watering can be best regulated by the person doing it,
as it depends entirely upon the size of the pot or jar in
proportion to the plant, whether it is too little or too
large, and the situation it stands in, whether moist or
arid. Never allow any quantity of water to stand in
the flats or saucers. This is too frequently practised
with plants in general. Such as <i>C&aacute;lla Æthi&ograve;pica</i>, or African
Lily, will do well, as water is its element, (like
<i>Sagitt&agrave;ria</i> in this country;) and the <i>Hydr&aacute;ngea hort&eacute;nsis</i>,
when in a growing state, will do admirably under such
treatment. Many plants may do well for some
time, but it being so contrary to their nature, causes
premature decay; a f&oelig;tid stagnation takes place at the
root, the foliage becomes yellow, and the plant stunted;
and in the winter season, death will ensue.</p>


<h4>OF CAMELLIA JAPONICA.</h4>

<p>In rooms the buds of Camellias will be well swelled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and on the Double White and Double Variegated sorts,
perhaps they will be full blown. While in that state
the temperature should not be below 34&deg;; if lower they
will not expand so well, and the expanded petals will
soon become yellow and decay. If they are where
there is fire heat, they must have plenty of air admitted
to them every favourable opportunity, or the consequence
will be, that all the buds will turn dark brown,
and fall off. It is generally the case, in the treatment
of these beautiful plants in rooms, that through too
much intended care they are entirely destroyed. In the
city, they do not agree with confined air, and they
cannot get too much of pure air, if they are kept from
frost or cutting winds. To sponge frequently will
greatly promote the health of the plants, and add to
the beauty of their foliage, as it prevents the attacks of
mildew. In this season they do not require much
water at root, which may be observed in the slight absorption
by the soil. See this subject under the head
of <a href="#Page_29"><i>Watering</i></a>.</p>

<p>When the flowers are expanded, and droop, tie them
up neatly, so that the flower may be shown to every
advantage.</p>


<h4>OF INSECTS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>Insects of various kinds will be appearing on your
plants. For method of destruction see <a href="#Page_9"><i>Hot-house</i>,
<i>January</i></a>. It will not be agreeable to fumigate the
room or rooms, or even to have the smell of tobacco
near the house from this cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Many ingredients have been compounded, and prescriptions
recommended, for the destruction of these
nefarious pests. Many of them are altogether ineffectual.
Of receipts specified in works of this kind, not a
few of them (though eagerly sought for) by men of extensive
practice, have been rejected. We shall give
the most simple, and in part effective receipt for the
destruction of the Green fly.</p>

<p>Take a large tub of soft water, (if the day is frosty, it
had better be done in the house,) invert the plant, holding
the hand, or tying a piece of cloth, or any thing of
the kind, over the soil in the pot, put all the branches
in the water, keeping the pot in the hand, drawing it
to and fro a few times; take it out, and shake it. If any
insects remain, take a small fine brush, and brush them
off, giving another dip, which will clean them for the
present. As soon as they appear again, repeat the
process&mdash;for nothing that we have found out, or heard
of, can totally extirpate them.</p>


<h4>OF BULBOUS ROOTS IN GENERAL.</h4>

<p>If you have retained any of the <i>Cape bulbs</i> from the
last planting, let them be put in, in the early part of the
month. For method, see <a href="#Page_309"><i>September</i></a>. Those that are
growing must be kept very near the light, that is, close
to the window, or they will not flourish to your satisfaction.
The fall-flowering oxalis may be kept on the
stage, or any other place, to give room to those that
are to flower.</p>

<p><i>Hyacinths</i>, <i>Jonquils</i>, <i>Narcissus</i>, <i>Tulips</i>, &amp;c. will keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
very well in a room where fire heat is constantly kept,
providing that they are close to the window. A succession
of these, as before observed, may beautify the
drawing room from February to April, by having a reserved
stock, in a cold situation, and taking a few of
them every week into the warmest apartment.</p>

<p>Wherever any of the bulbs are growing, and in the interior
of the room, remove them close to the light, observing
to turn the pots or glasses frequently to prevent
them from growing to one side, and giving them support
as soon as the stems droop, or the head becomes
pendant. The saucers under the Hyacinth and Narcissus
especially may stand with water, and observe to
change the water in the glasses, as already mentioned.</p>

<p>Every one that has any taste or refinement in their
floral undertakings, will delight in seeing the plants in
perfection; to have them so, they must be divested of
every leaf that has the appearance of decaying&mdash;let this
always be attended to.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="Hot-House1" id="Hot-House1"><span class="antiqua">Hot-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>FEBRUARY</i>.</h3>


<p>In the early part of this month the weather generally
is very cold and changeable in the middle states, and
strict attention, with the greatest caution, will require to
be paid to the management of the Hot-house. Most of
the tropical plants commence an active state of vegetation;
and if checked by temperature or otherwise, they
will not recover until midsummer. The thermometer
may be kept two or three degrees higher with fire
heat than last month; the sun will be more powerful,
and this will, in a great degree, increase the vigour of
the plants. Air may be admitted when the thermometer
rises to 75&deg; or 80&deg;, not allowing it to rise
higher than the latter. In giving air, let it be done by
the top sashes. It is improper to give it in any way to
cause a current, for the external air is very cold, although
the sun is more powerful. An inch or two on
a few of the sashes, as has been previously observed,
will be effectual in keeping the temperature low enough,
except the weather is very mild.</p>

<p>With regard to firing, what was said last month may
suffice for this. Always recollect that it is preferable
to keep out the cold than to put it out. It will frequently
happen in the time of intense frost, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
weather is dull. In such cases fire in a small degree
is requisite all day.</p>

<p>Heavy snows ought never to be allowed to remain
on the shutters while they are on the house. If the
snow lies on the sashes one day, the internal heat will
dissolve some of it; night coming on will freeze it to
the wood work, when it will become a solid mass, and
too frequently cannot be separated without much damage.
If allowed to remain on for two days, the plants
are very much weakened, and the foliage discoloured.
Therefore let the snow be cleared off instantly, that
no inconvenience may take place.</p>

<p>It will be observed that plants absorb more water
this month than last. The quantity given will require
to be increased, according to the increase of vegetation
and the advancement of the season; but never give
it until the soil begins to get dry, and then in such proportion
as will reach the bottom of the pot. After the
sun has got on the house in the morning is the best
time to water, observing all the directions given in
January.</p>


<h4>OF INSECTS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>Perhaps sufficient observations were given under
this head last month; but the importance of keeping
these disagreeable visitors out of the house, constrains
us to make a few more remarks, and perhaps it may
be necessary every month. Man cannot be too frequently
guarded against his foes, more especially when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
they are summoning all their forces, and no profession
has more than that of the Horticulturist. Let a strict
examination be made about the end of the month
for the Red spider; they will be in operation some weeks
before their depredations are observed on the foliage.
The under side of the leaf is their resort in the first instance,
and on such plants as have been already mentioned.</p>

<p>Observe daily the young shoots, in case the Green fly
becomes numerous. They give the foliage a very disagreeable
appearance, and with most people it is intolerable,
before their career is arrested. It also takes a
stronger fumigation, which has frequently to be repeated
the following day to the same degree, much to the
injury of many of the plants, and adding to the disagreeableness
of the continued vapour in the house.</p>


<h4>OF SHIFTING PLANTS.</h4>

<p>The <i>Calceol&agrave;rias</i> that were put in small pots about
the beginning or middle of last month, will, if they
have done well, require, about the end of this, to be
put in pots a size larger.</p>

<p>If any of <i>Lil&igrave;um longifl&ograve;rum</i>, <i>Speci&ograve;sum</i>, or <i>Jap&oacute;nicum</i>,
are wanted to flower early, and were put in the Hot-house
in December, without dividing, those that are to
flower will have pushed their flower stems, and can be
separated from those that will not flower, and put
singly into pots; the two former into five or six inch
pots, while the latter require six or seven inch pots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Of those that do not flower, three or four can be put
into one pot.</p>

<p>About the end of the month, some of the plants of
<i>Eurc&uacute;ma</i>, <i>Am&oacute;mum</i>, <i>K&aelig;mpf&eacute;ria</i>, <i>Gl&oacute;bba</i>, <i>Phrynium</i>, <i>C&aacute;nna</i>,
<i>Z&iacute;ngiber</i>, <i>Hedychium</i>, and others that are on the dry
shelf, will be offering to grow. Let them be taken out
of their pots, some of their weakest shoots or tubers
taken off, and the strong ones repotted: give gentle
waterings until they grow freely, then give an abundance.</p>

<p><i>Dion&aelig;a muc&iacute;pula</i>, or Venus fly trap, grows best in the
Hot-house, and will, about the end of the month, stand
in need of being repotted. This plant is very seldom
grown in any degree of perfection, having been always
considered a delicate plant in collections. The operator
has never had courage to treat it according to its
nature in a cultivated state. If it is taken out of the
pot, just when beginning to grow afresh, and divested
of all the soil, leaving only a few of the young roots,
(it is a bulb, and will receive no injury by so doing,)
put it in new soil; when potted, place the pot in a saucer
with one inch of water in it, giving always a fresh
supply, when necessary. A shady and moist situation
is best adapted to it; this being repeated every year,
it will grow, flower, and seed in perfection.</p>

<p><i>Gesn&eacute;rias</i>, if in small pots, give larger as they advance
in growth. This genus requires to be well
attended to make them flower well. <i>G. bulb&oacute;sa</i> ought
to have a situation in every Hot-house. It is remarkable
for its many brilliant crimson flowers, and continues
in flower for a length of time. When the bulb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
begins to push, shake it out of the earth, putting it into
a small pot; and, as soon as the roots reach the side
of the earth, which will be in about one month, put it
in a larger pot, and continue to do so until flowering,
which will be about the first of June, observing always
to keep the ball of earth entire.</p>

<p><i>Glori&oacute;sas</i> must be repotted in the beginning of this
month. Etymologists have said that this <i>genus</i> is
named from the glorious appearance of its flowers.
<i>G. sup&eacute;rba</i> is the most beautiful and curious. The
roots ought to be planted one and a half inch deep,
taking care not to break them; if there is a bark bed,
place the pots in it. Do not water much until they
begin to grow. Where there is no bark bed, put the
pots into others three inches larger, filling all round
with sand, and place them in the warmest part of the
house. Keep the sand moist, which will assist to keep
the soil in a moist state. The earth must not have
much water. As the plants grow, they will require a
more liberal supply; yet it is necessary, at all times, to
be moderate in giving it. If well treated, the superb
flowers will appear in June or July.</p>


<h4>OF CLEANSING PLANTS, HOUSE, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>With regard to cleaning the plants. Sprinkling, or
syringing, is at all times, to a greater or less degree,
necessary. The plants will, in this compartment, be in
their first stage of growth, and, if dust or foulness be
permitted to lodge on their foliage, the pores will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
obstructed, the plants will become unhealthy, and the
growth of insects increased.</p>

<p>Let all moss, litter, decayed leaves, or weeds, be
cleared out of the house, the earth in the pots stirred
up with a round pointed stick, and fresh earth given
where required, that the air may operate therein freely.</p>

<p>The house ought always to be sprinkled before
being swept, to prevent the dust rising.</p>

<p>Attend to the bulbous roots as directed last month,
such as <i>Hyacinths</i>, <i>Narcissus</i>, &amp;c.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Green-House1" id="Green-House1"><span class="antiqua">Green-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>FEBRUARY</i>.</h3>


<p>The directions given last month respecting the airing
and temperature of the house, may still be followed,
differing only in admitting air more freely as the season
advances, and according to the power the sun has on
the glass, which now begins to be considerable.</p>

<p>If the weather is tolerably mild, air may be admitted
in time of sunshine, so as to keep the mercury as low
as 45&deg;, but be cautious in cold, cloudy, frosty weather.
It is a practice with many in such weather to keep the
shutters on the house night and day, for the space of a
week, and sometimes more, never entering it; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
when the weather has induced them to look in, they
find that the frost and damp have made many lifeless
subjects; whereas, had the house and plants been attended
to, in taking off the shutters, and giving a little
fire when requisite, all would have been in safety, and
many that cannot be replaced still in the collection.</p>

<p>When watering, strictly adhere to the directions of
last month, except with <i>Geraniums</i>, and other soft
wooded plants, which require a little more water
toward the end of the month. If the days are mild
and sunny about eight or nine o'clock in the morning,
all the plants would be benefited by a gentle syringing,
which retards the progress of insects, and accelerates
vegetation.</p>

<p>Succulents, such as <i>C&aacute;ctus</i>, <i>Mesembry&aacute;nthemum</i>, <i>Aloes</i>,
<i>Furchr&aelig;as</i>, <i>Cr&aacute;ssulas</i>, <i>Cotyl&egrave;dons</i>, &amp;c. will very seldom
need water, at the same time keep them from getting
as dry as powder.</p>


<h4>OF ORANGES, LEMONS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>Similar treatment to that recommended last month
will do for this. Where the soil in the tubs or pots
requires to be enriched, take of bone dust or shavings,
and fresh sheep dung, equal quantities; put the mixture
into a large tub or barrel, until one third full; and fill
it up with water. Stir it well two or three times every
day for a week, then give each tree one good watering
with the compound. Continue to mix up afresh, and
let it stand another week, and so on until all the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
requiring it are watered. This watering will greatly
enrich the soil, and invigorate the roots.</p>


<h4>OF CAPE BULBS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>The bulbs, of <i>Ferr&agrave;ria undulata</i> and <i>F. anther&ograve;sa</i>, that
were taken out of the pots in October, will now require
to be planted. Five inch pots will be large enough
for good roots. The grand criterion for planting bulbs
is when there is a protuberant appearance about the
bottom, or root part of the bulb, showing, by a principle
of nature, the true time for transplanting. When
bulbous roots of any description appear above ground,
they ought to be placed in an airy situation. They
are very frequently placed under other plants, by the
inexperienced, until they show their flowers, and then
brought to the light, having weak flowers, and comparatively
of momentary existence.</p>

<p><i>Hyacinths</i>, <i>Narcissus</i>, <i>Glad&igrave;olus</i>, <i>Ixia</i>, &amp;c. having flower
stems, ought to have support, to prevent accident, especially
the two former; keep them nigh the glass, and
water freely. Change the water regularly in the bulb
glasses, observing that their roots are never allowed
to become matted with f&oelig;tid water. Any of the above
plants that are in flower, might, if desired, be taken
into the drawing room or parlour, washing the pots
clean, and putting saucers under them, keeping therein
a little water. Twice a week the decayed ones can
be taken out, and supplanted with those that are coming
into bloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>


<h4>CAMELLIA JAPONICA</h4>

<p>Will, in this month, show a profusion of flowers;
and, where there is a variety, they have truly a magnificent
appearance. From a good selection, endless
varieties, by seed, of exquisite beauty, might be obtained
by attention to the following rule. The best to select
for bearing seed are <i>Single white</i>, <i>Atoniana</i>, <i>Grandiflora</i>,
<i>Waratah</i>, <i>Carnation Waratah</i>, <i>Fulgens</i>, and, in many instances,
the pistil, or pistillum of <i>Variegata</i>, <i>Pompone</i>,
<i>P&aelig;oniflora</i>, and <i>Intermedia</i>, are perfect, with several others.
When any of the above are newly expanded, (<i>Waratah</i> is
most perfect about one day before expansion,) take a
fine camel hair pencil, and put it gently on the farina
or pollen, which is a yellow substance on the anthers,
and, when ripe, appears in thousands of small particles.
Take the finest double kinds, then, with this on the
pencil, rub lightly the stile of those intended to carry
seed. Between the hours of ten and twelve in the forenoon,
is the most proper time for the operation; the
seed will be ripe in September or October, which will
be taken notice of, and directions given. For other
particulars on cleaning and syringing, see <i>January</i>
under this head.</p>


<h4>OF SHIFTING &amp;c.</h4>

<p>The best time to repot <i>Camellias</i>, is just when they
are done flowering, which will be before they begin to
grow. There are, though not frequently, some flowers
after the young foliage begins to appear, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
it would be better to discriminate the time by the buds
offering to push, which will answer to those that have
no flowers, as well as those that have. The most
general time in shifting <i>Camellias</i> is in August and September,
indiscriminately with other plants; and, if then
not very gently handled, bad roots eventually are produced.
Frequently very fine plants have been killed
by probing, and breaking the young fibrous roots, thus
causing mortification.</p>

<p>In the process, do not, by any means, break, or bruise
any of the roots: and do not give large pots, with the
idea of making them grow fast: it acts on most plants
diametrically opposite to what is intended. A pot
one or one and a half inches wider and deeper than
the one they have been in previously, is sufficient.
Healthy plants under five feet will not require shifting
oftener than once in two years; from five feet upwards
in three or four years, according to the health of the
plants. This treatment, in the opinion of some, will
appear not sufficient: it will be found enough with a top-dressing
every year to keep them in a healthy, flowering
condition, the soil being according to our description.</p>

<p>On turning the plant out of the pot, it may easily
be observed if the soil has, in any degree, been congenial
to it; for if so, the roots will be growing all round
the ball; if otherwise, no roots will appear.</p>

<p>Therefore, with a blunt pointed stick, probe away all
the bad earth, until you come to the roots; then put
the plant in the pot about one inch in diameter, larger
than the combined roots, previously putting a few small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
pieces of broken pots, or clean gravel, to drain off the
superabundant moisture, and give light waterings, as
the roots in this case will grow but slowly.</p>

<p>Top dress all that requires shifting, probe out the
soil down to the roots, and by the side of the pot,
taking care not to break the fibres; then fill up with
fresh earth, watering gently with a rose on the watering
pot to settle it.</p>


<h4>OF CLEANING, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>If any of the plants require cleaning, either by fumigation
or otherwise, let it be done before the young
foliage appears, according to directions heretofore
given. Likewise tie neatly all that require it, clean
and top dress those that will not be shifted, having
every plant and all in the Green-house, in perfect order,
before the throng of spring commences. The weather
will now admit, in very fine mornings, of the plants
being syringed, which may be done between half past
seven and half past eight: and the path or pavement
should be washed out once a week, which is a great
improvement to the appearance of the whole interior.</p>

<p>In winter whenever any glass is broken it should be immediately
mended. Broken glass in cold nights causes
a very destructive current of air. It should always be
made water tight, for if the drops fall into the pots upon
the roots, they will frequently prove fatal to the plants;
therefore care ought to be taken during rain to remove
those that stand in any manner exposed.</p>

<h3><i>FEBRUARY</i>.</h3>


<p>Where the borders and beds were dug in the fall,
and compost or a thin coating of well decayed manure
given, the advantage will now in part be experienced.
If the weather is open about the end of the month, the
pruning should be done with the utmost despatch; that
all may be prepared for a general dressing next month,
and let nothing be delayed which can now properly be
accomplished, under the idea that there is time enough.</p>


<h4>OF PRUNING, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>Generally about the end of the month the very severe
frosts are over; and when none need be apprehended
that would materially injure hardy shrubs,
they may freely be pruned of all dead branches, and
the points cut off such shoots as have been damaged
by the winter. Most of shrubs require nothing more
than to be pruned of straggling, irregular, and injured
branches, or of suckers that rise round the root, observing
that they do not intermingle with each other.
Never trim them up in a formal manner. Regular
shearing of shrubs and topiary work have been expelled
as unworthy of a taste the least improved by reflections
on the beauty, simplicity, and grandeur of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
nature. In fact, the pruning of deciduous hardy shrubs
should be done in such a manner as not to be observable
when the plants are covered with verdure. It may
frequently be observed in Flower-gardens, that roses
and shrubs of every description are indiscriminately
cut with the shears, the <i>Am&oacute;rphas</i> and <i>Alth&egrave;as</i> sharing
the same fate.</p>

<p><i>Rob&iacute;nias</i>, <i>Col&ugrave;teas</i>, <i>Cyticus</i>, <i>Rh&uacute;s</i>, <i>Gen&iacute;stas</i>, with several
of the <i>Viburnums</i>, and many others, bear their flowers
on the wood of last year, and when thus sheared
afford no gratification in flowering. And those shrubs
that thus flower on the shoots of last year are perhaps
worse to keep in regular order, than those to which
the knife can be freely applied; but good management
while young will ensure handsome free flowering
plants.</p>

<p>Climbing shrubs, and others that are trained against
outbuildings, walls, or such as are sheltered thereby,
and not now in danger of suffering by frost, may be
pruned and dressed. These should be neatly trimmed,
and the branches moderately thinned out, tying in all
the shoots straight and regular. Avoid at all times, if
possible, the crossing of any shoots.</p>

<p>There is not a shrub in the garden that agrees so
well with close cutting, as the <i>Alth&egrave;a</i>, and all its varieties.
These can be made either bushes or trees,
and kept at any desired height. Where the wood of
last year is cut to about two or three inches from the
wood of the former year, the young shoots of this year
will produce the largest and finest flowers, and likewise
more profusely. When they have attained the desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
height, let them be kept in the most natural and handsome
shape that the taste of the operator can suggest.
They will bear cutting to any degree.</p>

<p>Honeysuckles of every description may with all freedom
be trimmed, providing the frost is not very severe.
These are very frequently allowed to become too
crowded with wood, and then superficially sheared or
cut. The flowers would be much finer, and the bush
handsomer, if they were regularly thinned out, divesting
them of all naked and superfluous shoots. Of those
that remain, shorten the shoots of last year. Where
any of the honeysuckle kind has become naked at the
bottom, and flowering only at the top of the trellis, or
extremities of the shoots, one half of the bush should
be cut to within four inches of the ground. It will
throw out plenty of fine young wood, which give room
for, and train them straight, and to the full extent,
during summer. These shoots will flower profusely
the following season, and in like manner, when thought
proper, the other half can be cut.</p>

<p>Roses of the hardy kinds (termed garden roses) that
were not attended to in November, should, if the weather
permit, be dressed and pruned forthwith. In small
gardens, where these are generally attached to the
walls and fences, neatness should be a very particular
object. If any of such bushes have got strong and
irregular, the most proper method to bring them to
order, will be to cut down each alternate shoot of the
bush to within a few inches of the surface, thereby renovating
it, and, in part, preserving the flowers. Those
that are cut down will put out several luxuriant shoots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
which must be regularly tacked in, spreading them in
a fan shape. These, in another year, will flower well,
when the others may go through the same operation.
Thus, in two or three years, the bushes will have resumed
a different, and more agreeable aspect. By
the above treatment, these ornaments of the garden
will always have a neat and healthful appearance, and
the roses will be much finer. Where they are intended
for the borders, they should never be allowed to get
too high. In a border from four to six feet, they ought
never to exceed four feet at the back of the border,
and in front, one foot, after being pruned; they can be
kept down by the above method. It is not advisable
to cut down rose bushes all at once, unless no regard
is paid to flowering. The roses that are in grass plats
would have a superior appearance in every respect, if
they were kept and trimmed like small trees. They
may be of different sizes and heights, according to the
extent of the grass plat or clump. A single stem may
arise from six inches to six feet, with a head in proportion
to the height of the stem. Where it is necessary
to have them above two feet, and likewise to carry a
good head, inoculation must be resorted to, which, in
the months of June and July, will be fully treated of.
All under two feet (except the weak growing kinds)
will do on their own stems, taking care not to allow
shoots to arise from the bottom during the summer.
For directions for pruning climbing roses, see March
and April.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>


<h4>OF PLANTING SHRUBS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>As soon as the frost is out of the ground, these
should be planted if the soil is not too wet. Where
soil is binding, upon no consideration plant in it while
wet, rather defer it until the end of March.</p>

<p>Shrubs, if they are well arranged, are the chief ornament,
give the most pleasure, and afford the greatest
delight that we enjoy in our gardens. Although they
give no sort of nourishment, nor produce any edible
fruits, yet they are particularly grateful and conducive
to our enjoyments. Our walks in summer would be
oppressive, but for their agreeable shade; in the fall
and winter, we would be left exposed to the chilling
winds, but for the shelter they afford.</p>

<p>Likewise they produce a great variety of flowers; a
varied foliage, and are standing ornaments that give
no great trouble. In the character of screens they are
particularly useful, whether to hide disagreeable objects,
or as a guard against the weather; and for either
of these purposes, they can be planted nearer to the
house than large trees. Or, if they are planted in
masses at a distance, they soon become agreeable objects,
frequently very much improve the scenery of the
place, become objects of utility as well as ornament,
and, in such case, afford the highest satisfaction.
When formed so as to exclude offices from the view of
the house, or for sheltering the latter, or for connecting
the house with the garden, orchard, or any similar
purpose, shrubs are both useful and interesting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Where many shrubs are to be planted, the disposing
of them properly is a matter of considerable importance
to the future welfare of the whole; and, whether
deciduous or evergreens be mixed or grouped, that is,
indiscriminately planted together, or the evergreens
planted by themselves, as is frequently done, a regular
and natural arrangement is indispensable for establishing
ornament.</p>

<p>Arranging, no doubt, depends very much on fancy;
still, there ought always to be plenty of evergreens
planted, that the whole may be more cheerful in winter.</p>

<p>If shrubberies were made to a great extent, the
scenery would be much more varied and characteristic
by grouping judiciously than by indiscriminately
planting.</p>

<p>However, in small flower gardens and shrubberies,
the latter has to be adopted. In such places, tall
growing kinds should never be introduced, unless
merely as a screen from some disagreeable object, for
they crowd and confuse the whole. The dwarf and
more bushy sorts should be placed next to the walks,
or edges, in order that they may conceal the naked
stems of the others. Generally when shrubs are planted,
they are small; therefore, to have a good effect
from the beginning, they should be planted much
thicker than they are intended to stand. When they
have grown a few years, and interfere with each other,
they can be lifted, and such as have died, or become
sickly, replaced, and the remainder can be planted in
some other direction. Keep them always distinct, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
from another, in order that they may be the better
shown off. But, if it is not desired that they should be
thicker planted than it is intended to let them remain,
the small growing kinds may be four or five feet apart;
the larger, or taller sorts, six or eight feet, according
to the condition of the soil.</p>

<p>Thick masses of shrubbery, called thickets, are
sometimes wanted. In these there should be plenty of
evergreens. A mass of deciduous shrubs has no imposing
effect during winter; and, as this is not the proper
season for planting evergreens, (April and October
being best,) small stakes can be placed in the
destined spot. Planting in rows, or in any plan of a
formal character, should at all times be avoided.</p>

<p>In planting at this season, observe that the roots are
not much exposed to the air, especially if the wind be
high and sharp; but it is always better, if possible, to
defer the business until good, mild weather. According
to directions in November, the ground will be well
prepared, and only requires a hole dug for the reception
of the roots, which must be considerably larger,
that the roots may not be in the least confined. Break
the earth well at bottom, put in as much as will receive
the plant from one to two inches (according to its size)
lower than it has previously been in the Nursery. If
any of the roots are bruised or broken, cut them off;
then place the plant in the centre of the hole, breaking
fine all the soil that is put in, at the same time shaking
the stem a little, that the earth may mix with the roots
when full up; press all the soil down with the foot, that
it may, in some degree, consolidate about the roots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and support the plant. If it is tall, or top heavy, put
in a good stake for a support, and place a small,
bandage between the stake and stem of the plant,
shrub, or tree, where the tie is to be made, to prevent
the bark from suffering by friction. Observe always
before planting, if the soil is not suitable, to supply that
which is congenial to the nature of the intended plant.</p>

<p>When shrubs or trees are to be carried to any distance,
the roots should be carefully kept from air, by
tying damp moss, straw, or Russia mats about them,
as circumstances will admit; their success greatly depends
on due attention being paid to this.</p>


<h4>OF HYACINTHS AND OTHER BULBOUS ROOTS.</h4>

<p>It sometimes occurs that <i>Hyacinths</i> and other bulbous
roots that were planted in the fall, are thrown
above ground by the frost. This will take place if the
soil is inclined to moisture, and they not being deep
enough planted. If such is the case, cover them with
wood earth, old decayed tan, or soil, whichever is
most convenient; if not done, the sun and air overpower
the bulbs, and, although the fibres have hold of
the ground, the flowers will be miserably weak. <i>Hyacinth</i>
bulbs, and many others of Holland, are very
hardy. Even exposure to our severest frosts would
not kill them, but they would be much weakened.</p>


<h4>OF FRAMING, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>Where a frame or hotbed is wanted to grow some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of the finest and more tender annuals, it is time, about
the 20th of the month, to collect and prepare manure
for the desired hotbed. And, as that operation, in
many instances, is very imperfectly performed, a few
observations on the subject may be useful.</p>

<p>Take three parts of fresh hot stable manure, with
one part of fresh oak leaves. Have a sufficient quantity
to make the intended bed or beds from three to
four feet high. Shake and mix up both together in a
compact conical heap, in order to encourage fermentation.
If the weather is cold and windy, cover it with
straw or leaves and boards, which is necessary to produce
the desired effect. If fermentation soon takes
place, it will need to be thoroughly turned over in
eight or ten days. If any of it has become dry and
musty from excessive heat, as you proceed, water the
affected parts, pile all up neatly, and leave it protected
in part as before. In five or six days more, it will
have to be turned again, repeating it until the first extreme
heat has been over. In neglect of this, the heat,
after making up the bed, will be vehement for a week
or two, frequently destroying the vegetative purity of
the soil, and proving destructive to the seeds.</p>

<p>Allowing the manure to come to a lively heat, having
no unpleasant, rancid smell, proceed to mark off
your intended bed, running it east and west as nearly
as possible, measure your frame, and allow the site of
the bed eight inches each way larger than the frame:
at the corners place a stick or rod perpendicularly.
The ground ought to be higher than that around it, to
prevent water from getting into the bed, which, if low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
must be filled up; or, if supposed that water may lodge
there, a little Brushwood might be put under the
manure, which would keep it from being inundated.
The manure must be built up square and level, shaking,
mixing, and beating it regularly with the back of
the fork. When you have it to the desired height,
(three feet will be sufficient for annuals,) leave the
centre of the bed a little higher than the sides, thus
allowing it more to subside. When finished, put on
the frame and sash or sashes, keep them close until
the heat arises, covering them at night with mats and
shutters. As soon as you feel the heat increased, give
air by tilting the sashes a few inches to let off the
steam and stagnated air, observing to close in the
afternoon, and cover at night. If the heat is violent,
about an inch of air might be left during the night.
In about three days, if all has been properly attended
to, the bed will be what is termed sweet. Then put in
about six inches of fine garden soil; if heavy, mix a
little sand with it. Spread it level, and, when the soil
is heated through, sow in small drills from one eighth
to an inch deep, according to the size of the seeds.
Some very small kinds do best when sown upon the
surface. When sown, give gentle sprinklings of
water until they come up, when it will be necessary to
give air to prevent them from being weak, or damping
off, which many of them will do if they have not air
regularly admitted. When they begin to crowd, thin
them out, to allow those that remain to grow strong.
It is better at all times to have one strong, healthy
plant, than two weak and sickly objects.</p>

<h2><a name="ROOMS1" id="ROOMS1"><span class="antiqua">Rooms.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>FEBRUARY</i>.</h3>


<p>At this season, the plants call for the most assiduous
attention. If the stage has been made according to
our description, in very cold nights it should be drawn
to the centre of the room, or at least withdrawn from
the window, observing every night to close the window
tight by shutters, or some substitute equally as good.
And, if the temperature begins to fall below 34&deg;, means
should be adopted to prevent it, either by putting a fire
in the room, or opening any adjoining apartment where
fire is constantly kept. This latter method is the best
where it is practicable, and ought to be studied to be
made so.</p>

<p>Some, very injudiciously, in extreme frosts put into
the room, where there is no chimney, amongst the
plants, a furnace of charcoal, in order to heat the
room. The effect is, that the foliage becomes dark
brown, and hardened like, and many of the plants die,
the rest not recovering until summer.</p>

<p>Watering may be attended to according to the directions
of January, only observing that those that
begin to grow will absorb a little more than those that
are dormant.</p>

<p>Roses, especially the Daily, if kept in the house, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
begin to show flower buds. Use means to kill the
Green-fly that may attack them.</p>

<p>Hyacinths and other bulbs must have regular attendance
in tying up, &amp;c. Take care not to tie them
too tight, leaving sufficiency of space for the stem to
expand. Give those in the glasses their necessary
supplies, and keep them all near the light. Never keep
bulbous roots while growing under the shade of any
other plant.</p>

<p><i>Camellias</i>, with all their varied beauties, will, in this
month, make a splendid show. Adhere to the directions
given in the previous month, and so that new
varieties may be obtained, (see <i>Green-house</i>, <i>February</i>,
under the head of <i>Camellia</i>,) which directions are
equally applicable here. When the flowers are full
blown, and kept in a temperature between 34&deg; and 44&deg;,
they will be perfect for the space of four, five, and frequently
six weeks, and a good selection of healthy
plants will continue to flower from December to April.</p>

<p>Be sure that there is air admitted at all favourable
opportunities. Give a little every day that there is
sunshine, if it is only for a few minutes.</p>

<h2><a name="Hot-House2" id="Hot-House2"><span class="antiqua">Hot-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>MARCH</i>.</h3>


<p>If this department has been regularly attended to,
the plants will be in a fresh healthy state. Where there
is any sickly appearance, heat has been deficient, or
insects of a destructive character are preying upon
them. Too much water at the root frequently causes
the foliage to become yellow. It will add greatly to
their general improvement, to syringe the whole twice
or three times a week, observing to do it in the morning
about sunrise; and it is highly necessary that the
water that is used should be of the same temperature
as the house; and at all times, whatever water is given
to the roots, the same must be observed. For airing,
see last month, observing, as the season advances, to
increase the quantity.</p>

<p>Continue to fumigate when any of the Green-fly appears,
(see<a href="#Page_12"> <i>January</i></a> for directions,) and where there
are any of the plants infected with the white scaly insect,
clean them as there directed. If overlooked
for a few months, they will be increased tenfold. Very
frequently, where there are only a few, they are neglected
until the plant is overrun with them, and then it
may be said, it is impossible to dislodge them entirely.
Clear off all decayed leaves from the plants. These
will have made fresh shoots, and the decayed leaves
very much disfigure the whole collection. We would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
not have repeated this observation, if it was not an essential
point, and one which is so frequently neglected.</p>


<h4>OF SHIFTING PLANTS.</h4>

<p>Those <i>Alstr&oelig;m&egrave;rias</i> that are growing freely, and in
small pots, should be put into pots of a larger size.
This genus of plants will not flower except they are
encouraged with frequent shifting: they are all beautiful.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Green-House2" id="Green-House2"><span class="antiqua">Green-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>MARCH</i>.</h3>


<p>The plants in this compartment will begin to assume
a different aspect, and air must be admitted every day
if practicable, giving large portions in sunshine by the
sashes regularly over all the house, opening those of
the front a little, and likewise the doors in fine mild
days. To perform this judiciously, give a little about
eight or nine o'clock, more at ten, and the whole from
eleven till twelve o'clock, shutting again by degrees.</p>

<p>Fire heat will now be dispensed with, but in frosty
nights have the shutters on about sundown. The sun
is now powerful, and the house can be early shut up in
the afternoon, and will gain as much natural heat as
will keep up the required temperature, viz. 36&deg; to 40&deg;.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Perhaps there may be uncommonly cold weather; at
such times be attentive to ward off danger by applying
artificial heat.</p>


<h4>OF WATERING.</h4>

<p>Look over the pots and tubs at least every alternate
day, to see where water is wanted. In watering, too
much caution cannot be used, especially during winter
and the commencement of spring. It was observed
last month what would be the effect of too much water.
It may be remarked, that if the exterior of the
pot is very damp, the soil inside is too wet, and in that
state is uncongenial to vegetation, which now begins
to start, and ought by all possible means to be encouraged.
People may be frequently observed watering
all plants indiscriminately, not taking the trouble to
look into or feel the state of the soil in the pots or tubs,
and by going over them three or four times in this
manner will be sufficient to put the plants in such a
state, that they will not be recruited for some months.
Hence the reason of so many sickly plants.</p>

<p><i>Cam&eacute;llias</i>, where there are collections, will continue
to flower. Treat them according to the directions given
last month.</p>


<h4>OF ORANGES, LEMONS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>Be sure they are not too wet, as too much humidity
as well as aridity causes their foliage to have a yellow
appearance, with this difference, that in the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
case the foliage is the same to the touch as when
green; but in the latter, it is soft and dry. We have
observed trees in tubs and half barrels, with holes all
round their sides. This is a ludicrous idea, having the
appearance of keeping the water from reaching the
bottom of the tub or barrel. For the best kind of tub
for large trees, see <i>August</i> under this head. If any of
the trees have stunted, straggling, or irregular heads,
about the end of this month, or beginning of next, head
or cut them down to the shape desired. The old wood
will push fresh shoots. You may cut close, or shorten
less or more, according as you desire young shoots to
arise; at the same time observe that you do not cut
below the graft or inoculation. Trees thus headed
down should be kept until May, and then planted in the
garden, (see <i>May</i>,) or if that cannot be done, turn it
out, and reduce the ball of earth by probing with a
pointed stick all round the sides and bottom of the
ball, cutting off any very matted roots. If any of the
roots are decayed, cut them into the sound wood. By
being thus reduced, it will go into the same pot or tub
if not a less one. Having a good supply of fresh earth
ready, put a few inches in the bottom of the pot or tub,
place the tree therein, and fill all round, at the same time
pressing it down with the hand or a stick. Give very
little water until there are signs of vegetation.</p>


<h4>MYRTLES, OLEANDERS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>These, with similar exotics, may be treated as
above. If any of them have been infected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
scaly insect, after heading down, &amp;c. scrub the remaining
stems with a strong decoction of tobacco, heated
to about 100&deg;. Afterwards clean with soap and water.</p>


<h4>GERANIUMS.</h4>

<p>These will be growing freely. Keep them in airy
situations, so that they may not grow too weak, and
flower imperfect. To flower these plants strong, and
of good colour, they must not be too crowded together,
neither far from the light, and have plenty of air admitted
to them, when the weather is favourable. Keep
them free from the Green-fly by fumigating frequently.</p>


<h4>HERBACEOUS PLANTS.</h4>

<p>Plants of this character will, by the first of the
month, begin to grow. The best time to divide and
fresh pot them is when the young shoots are about
one inch above ground. See under the head <i>Shifting</i>
in this month.</p>


<h4>OF CAPE BULBS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p><i>Cape Bulbs</i>, such as <i>Lachen&agrave;lias</i>, <i>Oxalis</i>, <i>Ixias</i>, <i>Glad&igrave;olus</i>,
<i>Wats&ograve;nias</i>, <i>Babi&agrave;nas</i>, &amp;c. will in many of the species
be showing flower. Keep all of them near the glass,
to prevent them from being weak and unsightly.</p>

<p><i>Hyacinths</i>, <i>Tulips</i>, <i>Narcissus</i>, &amp;c. Those that have
been kept in the Green-house during winter will be in
great perfection. Have all the flower stems tied up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
neatly to small stakes, (which, if painted green, will
look much better,) and keep them from the direct rays
of the sun. In the front of the house perhaps will be
the best situation. They must be freely watered while
in flower. Where there is convenience, it will be essential
to keep the pots in saucers containing water;
it will strengthen both stems and flowers, and likewise
preserve them longer in perfection. Those that are
blooming should be put aside, and watered sparingly,
until the foliage begins to decay, when the pots may
be laid on their side to ripen the bulbs.</p>


<h4>REPOTTING.</h4>

<p>If you have any of the following plants that you
are desirous of encouraging, they should be repotted
this or next month at the latest. Large plants
will not require it, if they were done in August.
Pots one size larger than those that they are in, are
sufficient. <i>Acacias and Mim&ograve;sas</i> being now united into
one genus, there are above two hundred species.
About one hundred and thirty belong to the Green-house.
Amongst such a beautiful family, both for elegance
of flower and beauty of foliage, it will be difficult
to specify the most handsome and desirable for this
department. <i>A. m&oacute;llis</i>, <i>A. glauc&eacute;scens</i>, <i>A. verticil&agrave;ta</i>, <i>A.
florab&uacute;nda</i>, <i>A. diff&ugrave;sa</i>, <i>A. arm&agrave;ta</i>, <i>A. vernicifl&ugrave;a</i>, <i>A. dec&uacute;rrens</i>,
<i>A. arm&agrave;ta</i>&mdash;weeping variety, <i>A. p&uacute;bescens</i>, <i>A. leucol&ograve;bia</i>,
<i>A. dec&iacute;piens</i>, <i>A. fragr&agrave;ns</i>, <i>A. pulch&eacute;lla</i>, <i>A. loph&aacute;ntha</i>,
<i>A. myrtif&ograve;lia</i>, &amp;c. These will afford a great variety of
foliage, and are very desirable, flowering principally in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
winter, or early in spring. The flowers of those belonging
to the Green-house are of a yellow or straw
colour; the most of those that are red or purple, with
the celebrated medicinal species, belong to the Hot-house,
for which see <a href="#Page_219"><i>May</i></a>. There are some of
the species very subject to the white scaly insect,
which must be attended to, that they may not get to
any extent.</p>

<p><i>Agap&aacute;nthus</i>, three species. They are all blue flowers.
<i>A. umbell&agrave;tus</i> is very celebrated, and well known in the
collections of the country. There is a variegated variety
of it highly desirable, the foliage being white
striped, and frequently the flower stem and the flower
are as good as the species. They have very strong
roots, and require plenty of freedom. Plants are
always large before they flower, and when the pots,
by frequent shifting, become inconvenient, the plant
should be divested of all the earth, and, if too large,
divide it, cutting off the strongest of the fibres; then
they will admit of being put into smaller pots. If the
above operation is performed in August or September,
it will not retard their flowering, which, when well
grown, is very handsome, the flower stem arising about
three feet, and crowned with twenty or thirty brilliant
blue blossoms, continuing to bloom successively.</p>

<p><i>Alons&ograve;as</i>, five species, all soft wooded, small, shrubby
plants, with scarlet flowers. <i>A. incisif&ograve;lia</i> is known
amongst us under the name of <i>Hem&iacute;meris urticif&oacute;lia</i>,
and <i>A. line&agrave;ris</i> as <i>H. line&agrave;ris</i>. If well treated, they form
very handsome plants, and flower freely. They will
not bear strong fumigation; and, when the house is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
under that operation, they must be put on the floor of
the Green-house, where they will not be so much affected.
They flower from May to August.</p>

<p><i>A&ugrave;cuba jap&oacute;nica</i> is the only species. The flowers are
small and almost insignificant, colour purple; but the
foliage is a desirable object, being yellow spotted, or
blotched. It is tolerably hardy, and withstands our
winters. It prefers shade, and, if the situation was
such when planted out, it would grow more freely.
The hot rays of the sun are very prejudicial to its
growth. It is an evergreen shrub, and very desirable.</p>

<p><i>Anagyris</i>, three species, evergreen, pea flowered
shrubs, flowers yellow, nothing very attractive in either
of the species. A. <i>f&oelig;tida</i> is found in many collections,
and we have no doubt but it may prove, in this country,
a hardy shrub.</p>

<p><i>Az&agrave;leas</i>, seven of the China species, which are those
we shall enumerate here. The one that has been
longest known in the collections of this country is <i>A.
&iacute;ndica</i>, a most splendid shrub, with scarlet cup flowers
and dark spots. <i>A. &iacute;ndica &agrave;lba</i>, flowers of the purest
white, and rather larger than the former. <i>A. &iacute;ndica
purp&ugrave;rea pleno</i>, double purple. This variety is not so
fine as any of the others. Properly it is not purple, or,
if it may be termed so, the colour is very light; the
flower irregular. <i>A. &iacute;ndica ph&oelig;n&iacute;cea</i> is magnificent.
The colour is darker, and the flower larger than <i>A. &iacute;ndica</i>,
and a free grower. <i>A. sin&eacute;nse</i>, flowers large, yellow.
The wood is much stronger than any of those
previously mentioned. It bears a very high character
in Europe. It has not yet flowered in our collection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
but appears as if it would in the ensuing season (1832).
All the above ought to have a situation in every Green-house.
They flower from March until May. There
are two other varieties which have not come under our
observation. Do not shift or repot them, if they are in
flower, until the flowering is over. The pots must be
well drained; and the plants require a shaded situation.
If they are properly treated, they will be completely
covered with their showy flowers every year.</p>

<p><i>A&ograve;tus</i>, two species, both fine leguminose plants. <i>A.
vill&ograve;sa</i>, is a native of Van Dieman's Land; and <i>A. virg&agrave;ta</i>,
is from New Holland. The former is preferable.
Both have yellow flowers, and are small evergreen
shrubs.</p>

<p><i>Anders&oacute;nia sprengelio&iacute;des</i>, is the only species, and
closely allied to <i>Ep&aacute;cris</i>, flowers small, and of a pale
yellow colour. Drain the pots well; flowers from
March to August.</p>

<p><i>Arbutus</i>, eight exotic species, and six varieties. They
are generally hardy in England; but we question if
they stand out in the middle states. <i>A. un&igrave;do r&ugrave;bra</i> has
the finest crimson flowers; <i>A. serratif&oacute;lia</i>, the largest
panicles; and <i>A. Andr&aacute;chne</i>, the finest foliage. They
flower in nodding panicles; the flowers are principally
white, tinged with green, and wax-like. They bear a
pretty fruit similar to a strawberry; hence it is called
strawberry tree, and the fruit will remain on the bush
a long time. They are very fine evergreens, and if any
of them become acclimated, they will be a great acquisition
to our gardens.</p>

<p><i>B&aacute;nksias</i>. There are about thirty-two species, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
curious in flower, and handsome and various in foliage;
flowers in large heads and cone-shaped anthers, mostly
green, and continue a considerable time in flower; produces
a cone in shape of a pine, but not imbricate.
The substance is as hard as bone, and contains many
seeds. A cone of <i>B. gr&aacute;ndis</i> in our possession weighs
one pound twelve ounces, and contains about 107 seeds.
Those most admired for the foliage are <i>B. dentata</i>, <i>B.
&aelig;mula</i>, <i>B. serr&agrave;ta</i>, <i>B. latif&ograve;lia</i>, <i>B. gr&aacute;ndis</i>, which is the
largest. <i>B. speci&ograve;sa</i> has the longest foliage. <i>B. Cunningh&aacute;mii</i>,
<i>B. spinul&ograve;sa</i>, <i>B. pallud&ograve;sa</i>, and <i>B. r&egrave;pens</i>, these
will afford a good variety. <i>B. verticill&agrave;ta</i> is entirely different
in appearance from the others.</p>

<p>They should be well drained, and placed in an airy
part of the Green-house. Great care should be taken
that they do not get too dry, for they seldom recover if
allowed to flag for want of water. This genus is named
in honour of Sir Joseph Banks, a distinguished promoter
of the study of natural history.</p>

<p><i>Bign&ograve;nias.</i> Those of this genus belonging to the
Green-house have been divided to <i>Tec&ograve;ma</i>, and there are
only three for this department. <i>T. austr&agrave;lis</i> known as
<i>B. Pand&ograve;r&aelig;</i>; <i>T. grandifl&ograve;ra</i>, known as <i>B. grandifl&ograve;ra</i>, and
has large and magnificent clusters of orange-coloured
flowers, flowering from May to October.</p>

<p><i>Tec&ograve;ma cap&eacute;nsis</i> is a very pretty climbing shrub, a free
grower, and flowers abundantly; flowers in dense panicles,
colour orange and red, continues for several weeks
in succession from April to August, greatly esteemed
in Europe where it is known; being now in a few of our
collections, will soon be generally admired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bl&egrave;tia hyacinth&igrave;na</i> is the only species belonging to the
Green-house, once known as <i>Cymb&iacute;dium hyacinth&igrave;num</i>.
It is herbaceous, and when it begins to grow divide the
root, putting the best into five inch pots. The spike of
flowers are hyacinth-like, and of a beautiful purple,
flowering from April to July.</p>

<p><i>Bor&ograve;nia</i> is a beautiful genus of New Holland plants,
contains about nine species; most of them have been
universally admired; the flowers are star-like, and rose-coloured,
and some of them sweet-scented. <i>B. pinn&agrave;ta</i>
grows and flowers freely. <i>B. serrul&agrave;ta</i>, foliage serrated
and very crowded, bearing the flowers on the extremity
of the shoot. <i>B. al&agrave;ta</i> has a fine appearance, and
grows handsomely. The foliage is winged and pinnate,
of a hardy nature, and easy culture, flowers freely.
They are in flower about April and May, and continue
a considerable time; are subject to mildew if not frequently
syringed; drain the pots well.</p>

<p><i>Bouv&aacute;rdias</i>, two species. <i>B. triphylla</i> is well known
amongst us, has brilliant scarlet flowers, and when
well grown, will flower beautifully from May till September.
To keep the plants, they should be frequently
renewed; otherwise they are liable to grow straggling,
and become subject to the small white scaly insect.
<i>B. Jacqu&igrave;n&aelig;</i> we suspect has got confounded with
the former, being very little different, except the foliage,
which is more pointed. They flower from the
young wood, and often throw their foliage in winter.</p>

<p><i>Brachys&egrave;mas</i>, two species, both evergreen climbers.
<i>B. latif&ograve;lium</i> has the best foliage, and large purple leguminose
flowers. <i>B. undul&agrave;tum</i>, flowers yellow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
more plentiful than the former, continuing in long successions.
The pots require to be well drained; very
few plants of either in the country.</p>

<p><i>Burch&eacute;llias</i>, two species. <i>B. cap&eacute;nsis</i> is a beautiful
dwarf evergreen shrub, with tubular scarlet flowers in
large terminate clusters; when well treated, grows and
flowers freely, and highly deserving of attention. <i>B.
parvifl&ograve;ra</i> differs from the above in the flowers being
smaller and paler, and the foliage more pointed.</p>

<p><i>Beauf&oacute;rtias</i>, only two species. <i>B. decuss&agrave;ta</i> is splendid;
the flowers come out of the wood with stamens
in fine parcels, colour bright scarlet, foliage decussate,
oval, and many-nerved, bloom persistent, and much
esteemed. <i>B. sp&aacute;rsa</i>, in flower similar to the other,
colour light pink, foliage scattered, both easy of culture,
and flower abundantly.</p>

<p><i>Br&ugrave;nias</i>, about ten species, have heath-like foliage,
very fine, generally, on close observation, found to be
three cornered. The flowers are white and globular,
the plants when young are very handsome; the finest
are <i>B. nodifl&ograve;ra</i>, <i>B. lanugin&oacute;sa</i>, <i>B. com&ograve;sa</i>, <i>B. abrotano&iacute;des</i>,
and <i>B. form&ograve;sa</i>. They require an airy situation, and
in summer to be protected from the powerful rays of
the sun. Drain the pots well.</p>

<p><i>B&oacute;sea yervam&oacute;ra</i>, Golden rod tree, leaves large, alternate,
ovate, acute, with purple veins and nerves,
flowers brown, in axillary dense panicles, grows strong
and freely.</p>

<p><i>B&aelig;ckias</i>, above twelve species, of heath-like appearance,
and except for variety, are not otherwise desirable.
<i>B. camphor&agrave;ta</i> is camphor-scented; <i>B. pulch&eacute;lla</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
is very neat; and <i>B. virg&agrave;ta</i> flowers freely. Pots
should be well drained. The flowers of all the genus
are white.</p>

<p><i>Billardi&eacute;ras</i>, about five species, are desirable as
climbers, being of rapid growth, and abundant in
flower. <i>B. longifl&ograve;ra</i>, fruits freely, and has fine blue
berries which look handsome. <i>B. mut&aacute;bilis</i> is changeable
from purple to scarlet. The fruit of <i>B. sc&agrave;ndens</i> is
covered with down, flowers straw coloured. <i>B. fusif&oacute;rmis</i>
differs in colour from the others, the flowers
being blue. They require to be well drained.</p>

<p><i>Calceol&agrave;rias</i>, about fourteen species, besides many
hybrid varieties. <i>C. angustif&ograve;lia</i>, and <i>C. integrif&ograve;lia</i> are
the best of the shrubby species. <i>C. plantag&iacute;nea</i>, <i>C. corymb&oacute;sa</i>,
<i>C. purp&ugrave;rea</i>, and <i>C. hopi&aacute;na</i>, and of the hybrid
varieties, <i>C. mic&agrave;ns</i> and <i>C. hybr&igrave;da</i> are very fine; but
we understand they are numerous, and some of them
very splendid.</p>

<p>To grow any of these properly, they should be divided
a few weeks after they begin to grow; put them
in small pots at first, and enlarge them gradually.
Where there is a hot-house, after dividing them, it will
greatly promote their growth to keep them in it a few
weeks near the glass, until the weather gets mild,
when they may be removed to the Green-house. The
flowers are principally yellow. <i>C. Fotherg&iacute;llii</i>, <i>purp&ugrave;rea</i>,
and <i>archnoidea</i> are purple; the hybrids are spotted with
red and brown, and some of them streaked many colours.
They continue a long time in flower.</p>

<p><i>Caloth&aacute;mnus</i>, four species. This genus is named in
allusion to the splendid appearance of the branches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
covered with scarlet flowers of curious construction,
which come out of the old wood. All the species are
of easy culture, and very like dwarf pines. <i>C. quadr&iacute;ffida</i>
has the largest flowers; <i>C. clav&aacute;ta</i> the most abundant.
They are all evergreens, and flower from April to
November.</p>

<p><i>Cam&eacute;llias.</i> There are about nine species, celebrated
over the known world as furnishing the domestic drug
called tea, in universal use, besides many flowering
trees and shrubs as universally admired. Oil may be
expressed from the seeds of all the species, and used
as that of hemp and poppy in cookery. <i>C. v&iacute;ridis</i> and
<i>C. boh&egrave;a</i> are said to be the species which supply the
tea. Some have asserted that there is only one shrub
used, but by examination it may be easily perceived
that there are leaves of various shape and texture, some
of them similar to <i>C. sasanqua</i>. Dr. Abel gives an explicit
detail of the growing and manufacturing process
of tea, from which, in compliment to our fair patrons,
we give a few extracts:</p>

<p>"The tea districts of China extend from the twenty-seventh
to the thirty-first degree of north latitude. It
seems to succeed best on the sides of mountains. The
soils from which I collected the best specimens consisted
chiefly of sand-stone, schistus, or granite. The
plants are raised from seeds sown where they are to
remain. Three or more are dropped into a hole four
or five inches deep; these come up without further
trouble, and require little culture, except that of removing
weeds, till the plants are three years old. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
more careful stir the soil, and some manure it, but the
latter practice is seldom adopted. The third year the
leaves are gathered, at three successive gatherings, in
February, April and June, and so on until the bushes
become stunted or slow in their growth, which generally
happens in from six to ten years. They are then
cut in to encourage the production of fresh roots.</p>

<p>"The gathering of the leaves is performed with care
and selection. The leaves are plucked off one by one:
at the first gathering only the unexpanded and tender
are taken; at the second those that are full grown;
and at the third the coarsest. The first forms what is
called in Europe imperial tea; but as to the other
names by which tea is known, the Chinese know nothing;
and the compounds and names are supposed to
be made and given by the merchants at Canton, who,
from the great number of varieties brought to them,
have an ample opportunity of doing so. Formerly it
was thought that green tea was gathered exclusively
from <i>C. v&iacute;ridis</i>; but that is now doubtful, though it is
certain that there is what is called the green tea district
and black tea district; and the varieties grown in
the one district differ from those of the other. I was
told by competent persons that either of the two
plants will afford the black or green tea of the shops,
but that the broad thin-leaved plant (<i>C. v&iacute;ridis</i>) is preferred
for making the green tea.</p>

<p>"The tea leaves being gathered, are cured in houses
which contain from five to twenty small furnaces, about
three feet high each, having at top a large flat iron pan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
There is also a long low table covered with mats, on
which the leaves are laid, and rolled by workmen, who
sit round it: the iron pan being heated to a certain degree
by a little fire made in the furnace underneath, a
few pounds of the fresh-gathered leaves are put upon the
pan; the fresh and juicy leaves crack when they touch
the pan, and it is the business of the operator to shift
them as quickly as possible, with his bare hands, till
they cannot be easily endured. At this instant he takes
off the leaves with a kind of shovel resembling a fan,
and pours them on the mats before the rollers, who,
taking small quantities at a time, roll them in the palm
of their hands in one direction, while others are fanning
them, that they may cool the more speedily, and retain
their curl the longer. This process is repeated two or
three times, or oftener, before the tea is put into the
stores, in order that all the moisture of the leaves may be
thoroughly dissipated, and their curl more completely
preserved. On every repetition the pan is less heated,
and the operation performed more closely and cautiously.
The tea is then separated into the different
kinds, and deposited in the store for domestic use or
exportation.</p>

<p>"The different sorts of black and green arise, not
merely from soil, situation, or the age of the leaf; but
after winnowing the tea, the leaves are taken up in
succession as they fall; those nearest the machine
being the heaviest, are the gunpowder tea; the light
dust the worst, being chiefly used by the lower classes.
That which is brought down to Canton, then under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>goes
a second roasting, winnowing, packing, &amp;c. and
many hundred women are employed for these purposes."
K&aelig;mpfer asserts that a species of <i>Cam&eacute;llia</i> as well as
<i>Olea fr&agrave;grans</i> is used to give it a high flavour.</p>

<p><i>C. ole&iacute;feria</i> is cultivated principally in China for the
oil which is expressed from its seeds, which is much
used in the domestic cookery of the country; flower
single white.</p>

<p><i>C. Ses&aacute;nqua</i>, Lady Banks's. The foliage of this
species is very small, and paler, and the green not so
fine, as any of the others. It seeds freely, and is often
used as the female parent in producing new varieties;
flowers small white and single, with many anthers.
There are a Semi-double, and Double variety of it of
the same colour.</p>

<p><i>C. malifl&ograve;ra</i> is figured in the Botanical Register, under
the name of <i>C. Ses&aacute;nqua r&oacute;sea</i>. The foliage is about
the same shape as <i>C. Ses&aacute;nqua</i>, but the appearance and
habit of the plant are completely different, growing very
freely and quite erect; flowers very abundant. A large
plant of it will continue in bloom for the space of three
months. The flowers are of about six weeks' duration,
colour and shape of <i>Rose de meaux</i>; has been
highly esteemed. One plant of it has been sold for
one hundred and eighty dollars.</p>

<p><i>C. K&iacute;ssii</i>. We believe it is single white, has not come
under our observation, the only species that is a native
of Nepaul.</p>

<p><i>C. reticul&aacute;ta</i> was brought from China by Capt. Rawes.
The foliage is very characteristic, being rougher than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
any of the other flowers, about five inches in diameter,
brilliant scarlet, and semi-double. It was introduced
into Europe in 1822, and is still very scarce. Twenty-five
dollars are paid for a small twig of it. From present
appearance, it will never be so plenty as many of
the others, being tardy of propagation; only a few eyes
on the extremity of each shoot make young wood,
and if these are cut off, the plant does not seem to
push afresh.</p>

<p>C. <i>jap&oacute;nica</i>, the original of many splendid varieties,
probably to the amount of one hundred. The true one
is in very few collections; it is single striped.</p>

<p>C. <i>jap&oacute;nica r&ugrave;bra</i> is the single red of our collections,
and used as stocks to enarch, graft, or inoculate the
other varieties upon, being easily struck by cuttings.
It seeds very freely, when the stile is impregnated, and
the seedlings make the strongest and best stocks.</p>

<p>C. <i>jap&oacute;nica &aacute;lba</i>, single white. It is mentioned in some
of our catalogues, as being very sweet-scented, though
not very perceptible to us. The foliage and wood are
very strong, being a free seeding variety, consequently
particularly desirable, as a stock to grow new varieties
from. Its flowers are large and abundant.</p>

<p>C. <i>semid&uacute;plex.</i> This is a flower with two rows of
petals. Some good varieties might be got from it,
if properly impregnated.</p>

<p>C. <i>r&ugrave;bro-pl&egrave;no</i> is a strong growing and free-flowering
variety. The flowers are large, double red,
petals irregular, with the anthers in bunches amongst
them; flowers are of long duration and showy.</p>

<p>C. <i>c&aacute;rnea</i>, frequently known as Middlemist's blush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Colour pink, one of the original varieties, and frequently
produces seeds; grows freely.</p>

<p>C. <i>myrtif&oacute;lia</i>, known in some collections as <i>invol&uacute;ta</i>.
There are two varieties of it, major and minor; the
former is certainly the best, and has a very handsome,
large, and regular red flower; the centre frequently is
pink and purple; it is much the shape of <i>Double white</i>,
only the petals are more cupped. The flower is of
considerable duration. It is not properly named. The
foliage, though the smallest of the variety, is much
larger than that of any of our common myrtles, which
might make many mistake its character; and another
prominent feature is, the leaves are much recurved and
shining.</p>

<p>C. <i>hexangul&aacute;ris</i>. The flower is six angled, very compact,
and dark red. It is an esteemed variety, and
there has unfortunately been another inferior, substituted
for it, in some of our collections. The foliage is
similar in shape to <i>anemonifl&ograve;ra</i>, with the nerves more
sunk; the flowers are of an ordinary size.</p>

<p>C. <i>atro-r&ugrave;bens</i>, Loddiges' red, is a very fine variety;
colour dark red outside, petals large inside, small and
irregular, forming a very distinct character; foliage
stiff; grows freely and flowers well; and of long duration.
We have seen a flower stand fresh on the plant
two months; however, that cannot be a rule, as it depends
on the situation.</p>

<p>C. <i>anemonifl&ograve;ra</i>, or <i>Waratah</i> (from the central petals,
having the appearance of the Waratah plant, <i>Telop&igrave;a
speciosissima</i>.) This variety is very characteristic, both
in flower and foliage. The flower is dark crimson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
with five or six regular large outside petals; those of the
centre are very small, and neatly plaited, with the stile
(female organ) prominent; the foliage is large and oblong,
nerves very smooth, and the wood strong, bark
light. Had this kind not been found, we would have
been deprived of many most splendid varieties, which
have originated from it, and we have no doubt they may
become as diversified as the roses of the garden. This
variety in a collection for that alone is invaluable. It
seeds freely, and the pollen of any of the others applied
to the style of this, will produce a new variety,
which seldom fails of being double, provided the pollen
is from a double variety. It must be applied the first
day that the flower is expanded, for the flower is only
of a few days' duration. Those that are not acquainted
with the buds of this <i>Cam&eacute;llia</i>, will take them to be
dead, because, before expansion, they are very dark
brown.</p>

<p><i>C. dianthifl&ograve;ra</i>, or Knight's <i>carnation Waratah</i>, is, when
well grown, a very beautiful flower; shape and size
same as <i>anemonifl&ograve;ra</i> (and a seedling from it by Mr.
Knight, King's Road, Chelsea, London,) seemingly the
stamens are crowned with small petals, red and white
striped, appearing like a fine large carnation. The
style appears fertile, and there is no doubt but some
splendid varieties may be obtained from it.</p>

<p><i>C. bl&aacute;nda</i>, or blush Waratah, flower in shape similar
to <i>anemonifl&ograve;ra</i>, rather larger, and of considerable duration.</p>

<p><i>C. pomp&oacute;nia</i>, or Kew blush, flowers very large, white,
with a tinge of blush at the bottom of the petals, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
has a good effect in setting off the flower. They frequently
bloom all blush, which appears rather curious
on the same plant; shape one or two rows of guard or
outside petals; those of the inside are short, stubby,
and generally irregular, continues long in flower, yellow
anthers among the short petals, and seeds when
the female organ is perfect; foliage narrower than any
of the others, a very fast grower, and flowers freely.</p>

<p><i>C. p&aelig;&ograve;niflora</i>. The foliage, shape, and size of the
flower of this, is similar to the last mentioned, colour a
rich pink; we have never seen any of them vary from
this; and have seen it seed very double.</p>

<p><i>C. Walb&aacute;nkii</i>, has a very large white irregular flower,
by some called poppy-flowered. It is not so pure as
the common double white; the anthers show amongst
the petals, and the buds before expansion are very
round, inclining to flatness; the foliage long and shining.
The flowers are of considerable duration. We question
with lutea-alba.</p>

<p><i>C. alba-pl&egrave;na</i>, common double white, is admired by
the most casual observer, and is generally considered
a very superior flower, from the purity of its whiteness,
and the abundance of its large flowers, which are
thickly and regularly set with round petals. The
foliage is large, and the plant grows freely; we have
seen one shoot grow two feet in one summer. It was
imported into Europe from China, amongst the first of
the varieties, about eighty years ago.</p>

<p><i>C. flav&eacute;scens</i>, Lady Hume's blush, and by some called
<i>buff</i>. It is a very double flower, and frequently hexangular;
the bottom of the petals are most delicately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
tinged with blush; on looking into it, it shows more
like a blush vapour than nature, and is a great favourite,
and deservedly so, with the ladies: flowers and
grows freely, foliage rhomboid, elongate, nerves very
visible, surface smooth and pale green, distantly serrate.</p>

<p><i>C. fimbri&agrave;ta.</i> The size, shape, and set of the flower
same as <i>alba-plena</i>, and the white as pure, with the
edges of the petals deeply serrated, or rather fringed;
is equally as free in flowering and growing. It is universally
admired, and in great demand. Its character
is unique, foliage very like <i>alba-pl&egrave;no</i>. [See Frontispiece.]</p>

<p><i>C. imbric&agrave;ta</i>, said to be a very double red, with imbricated
petals, and very handsome. We have not seen
it in flower.</p>

<p><i>C. variag&agrave;ta</i>, is one of the old standard varieties, and
very much esteemed. It is striped with red and white;
sometimes the ground is red, with white streaks or
blotches, and <i>vice versa</i>. The flower when well grown
is large, and very abundant; foliage very fine dark
green, similar to single white. We have had seed from
it. The petals are regular, with the anthers showing
amongst them; the flower double, though not so much
so as many of the others.</p>

<p><i>C. crassin&eacute;rvis.</i> We have not the smallest doubt but
this is the same as <i>hexangularis</i>, and in confirmation of
our opinion, we have lately had the best authority in
Europe to that effect.</p>

<p><i>C. conchifl&ograve;ra</i>, shell flowered, double, a very handsome
shape, petals round, stiff set, and in the centre
quite erect, red with occasional splashes of white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p><i>C. rubric&aacute;ulis</i>, Lady Campbell's, very double, colour
very rich dark red, with stripes of pure white, beautifully
contrasted. The richness of this flower is very
striking, and much esteemed; flowers freely.</p>

<p><i>C. longif&ograve;lia</i> is a single red, the foliage is large, and
longer than the generality of them.</p>

<p><i>C. chandlrerii</i>, or versicolor, colour vivid scarlet with
occasional splashes of pure white; the flowers vary, and
are of long duration, from six to eight weeks; foliage
large and dark glossy green.</p>

<p><i>C. ait&ograve;nia</i>. This variety is a beautiful specimen of
a single flower affording a developement of the organ
of fructification; the petals are delicately penciled,
and the anthers very bold, colour pink, and the flower
very large; grows freely, and, in our opinion, is surpassed
by none of the single sorts, for raising fine new
varieties, if impregnated with the pollen from double
flowers.</p>

<p><i>C. alth&aelig;ifl&ograve;ra</i>, hollyhock-flowered, is a great beauty,
with large double dark red flowers, the veins are very
prominent, petals frequently irregular; foliage large,
and approaches to the foliage of single red; and is
much esteemed.</p>

<p><i>C. corall&igrave;na</i>, coral-flowered, a very deep scarlet double
flower, and bears a high character.</p>

<p><i>C. ins&iacute;gnis</i>, a most splendid double flower, large dull
red colour; a very free grower, and highly estimated.</p>

<p><i>C. anemonefl&ograve;ra &aacute;lba</i>. Those that have seen the
common <i>anemonefl&ograve;ra</i> will be disappointed in the appearance
of this, not being pure white, neither properly
anemone-flowered, though a very good flower, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
very distinct from any other; the petals are irregular,
anthers abundant, shape resembling <i>pompone</i>; flower
not so large.</p>

<p><i>C. heterophylla</i>. The foliage of this varies very
much, a character that none of the others possess;
flower double red; and merits a place in collections.</p>

<p><i>C. Wo&oacute;dsii</i>, flower fine double, rose colour; and
much has been said in its favour.</p>

<p><i>C. b&iacute;color</i>, a single flower, with a rose ground and
white streaks, very pretty, but not so large as many of
the single ones.</p>

<p><i>C. speciosa</i> is a most splendid variety, has been called
<i>China striped Waratah</i>. The guard petals are large,
round, and bold; colour red with stripes of white; the
centre is full of small petals, (like <i>anemonefl&ograve;ra</i>,) and
spotted; the foliage large and more heart-shaped than
any of the others; grows freely, flower persistent,
highly esteemed, and considered one of the finest of
the coloured <i>Cam&eacute;llias</i>.</p>

<p><i>C. f&uacute;lgens</i>, flower large, and very bright double red,
approaching to <i>C. atro-rubens</i>, but more brilliant; foliage
a lucid green, very smooth, young wood and wood
buds have a red appearance. We have no doubt but
it will seed; if so, it will be a first rate breeder.</p>

<p><i>C. grandifl&oacute;ra</i>, a very large single rich red flower, foliage
very large; a most splendid single variety, and
grows freely. It is recommended to all who wish to
improve their collections by raising new varieties.</p>

<p><i>C. r&oacute;sa sin&eacute;nsis</i>, a very large double flower, colour
bright pink, petals long and full, a very distinct variety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
with a beautiful dark green shining foliage, grows and
flowers freely, and is highly esteemed.</p>

<p>C. <i>interm&eacute;dia</i>, a very large flower, shape of <i>C. pomp&ograve;nia</i>,
outside petals streaked to the extremity with a
rich blush, ground colour pure white, and is in high
estimation; grows and flowers freely. It is in very
few collections in Europe, and only in three in the
United States.</p>

<p>C. <i>rose Warat&aacute;h</i>. The description of this flower is the
same as <i>anemonefl&ograve;ra</i>, but differs in colour, and being of
longer duration, the foliage is uncommonly large.</p>

<p>C. <i>Press&iacute;i's invincible</i>. It has been asserted that
it is the same as that known by <i>C. punctata</i> and <i>C.
Press&iacute;i</i>. We have not seen it flower, but have seen a
drawing of it, the flower equally as large as <i>double white</i>,
and same shape, with the petals as regular; the ground
colour brilliant red, and spotted with pure white. It is
one of the newest varieties, and much valued for its
unique beauty; hence called <i>Invincible</i>; foliage large.</p>

<p>C. <i>Rose Mundi&iacute;</i>, is like the garden rose of that name;
a large flower, ground colour pink streaked with white.</p>

<p>C. <i>comp&agrave;cta</i> is a new double white, petals and flower
not so large as the common, but more compact, and is
considered a very fine variety.</p>

<p>C. <i>glori&ograve;sa</i>, is said to be a fine dark double red.</p>

<p>C. <i>R&oacute;ssii</i>, is said to be a fine rich double scarlet.</p>

<p><i>Callic&ograve;ma serratif&ograve;lia</i>, the only species and remarkable
for tufted yellow heads of flowers, which come out at
the axils, and continue from May to July. The foliage
is ovate lanceolate, deeply serrated, and opposite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Carmich&aelig;lia austr&agrave;lis</i>, the only species, has very curious
foliage, which the lilac leguminose flowers come
out off, and continue from April to June.</p>

<p><i>Cun&ograve;nia cap&eacute;nsis</i>, the only species, and a handsome
shrub, with large pinnated shining leaves, beautifully
contrasted by numerous dense elongated branches of
small white flowers, and twigs of a red colour, having
the habit of a tropical more than a Cape of Good Hope
plant.</p>

<p><i>Cl&eacute;thra arb&oacute;rea</i>, and <i>C. arb&oacute;rea variag&agrave;ta</i>, are both fine
shrubs; the latter is preferable; leaves are oblong, accuminate,
and serrated with a gold edge; flowers white,
downy, in large branching racemose spikes, and sweet-scented;
grows freely.</p>

<p><i>Cotone&aacute;sters</i>. Two of this genus are deserving a situation
in the Green-house, <i>C. denticul&agrave;ta</i>, and <i>C. microphylla</i>;
the last is a native of the mountainous districts
of Nepaul, and may prove hardy; the flowers are
white, small, and solitary, but in the fall it is covered
with pretty red berries, and then looks beautiful; culture
very easy; will grow in any situation.</p>

<p><i>Cr&ograve;wea sol&iacute;gna</i>, is amongst one of the finest and
easiest cultivated plants of New South Wales. It
flowers at the axils of the leaves, colour pink, with five
petals, connected by entangled hairs; in flower from
April to December, and frequently through the winter;
foliage lanceolate, and a fine green. The plant grows
neat, and requires an airy situation; drain the pots
well.</p>

<p><i>Choriz&egrave;mas</i>, about six species, foliage very like some
varieties of the <i>Holly</i>; flowers small and papiliona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ceous;
colour red and yellow; though small, they are
very neat. C. <i>n&agrave;na</i> and C. <i>ilicif&ograve;lia</i> are amongst the
best; if grown from seed, they will flower freely the
second year; drain the pots well.</p>

<p><i>Ciner&agrave;rias</i>, Cape aster, about twelve belong to the
Green-house. They are herbaceous, or half shrubby,
soft wooded plants. C. <i>speci&ograve;sa</i>, C. <i>amello&iacute;des</i>, (now
called <i>Agath&aelig;a c&aelig;l&eacute;stus</i>,) C. <i>purp&ugrave;rea</i>, and C. <i>lan&agrave;ta</i>, are
among the finest; flowers blue or yellow; the latter is
considered the handsomest of the genus. The exterior
petals are bright purple, and the interior ones
white, and with <i>A. c&aelig;l&eacute;stus</i>, flowers most of the year;
flowers syngenesious and star-like. The herbaceous
species must be treated as previously mentioned for
that kind of plants.</p>

<p><i>C&iacute;stus</i>, or Rock rose. There are above thirty species,
principally natives of Europe, consequently hardy
there, and form a great ornament to their gardens,
being very abundant and various in flower; but with
us they will not stand the rigour of winter. We have
no doubt, however, but, through time, some kinds may
be grown that will withstand the greatest cold of the
middle states; they are low shrubby plants of easy cultivation.
C. <i>ladan&iacute;ferus</i>, C. <i>monspeli&eacute;nsis</i>, C. <i>s&aacute;lignus</i>, C.
<i>popolif&ograve;lius</i>, and C. <i>undul&agrave;tus</i>, are perhaps the best;
the flowers are of short duration, frequently only for one
day; but the quantity makes up this deficiency, being
constantly in flower in May and June, and sometimes
flower again in autumn. C. <i>cr&egrave;ticus</i> is most productive
of the Gum laudanum, which is secreted about its
leaves and branches. The flowers are generally five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>-petaled,
and some of them large; centre full of stamens;
the foundation of the natural order <i>Cistinea</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cl&eacute;matis</i>, Virgin's Bower. There are only six of
these belonging to this, all climbing plants. C. <i>arist&agrave;ta</i>
and C. <i>brachi&agrave;ta</i> are the best; flowers in racemose
clusters, pure white; foliage small; and natives of the
Cape of Good Hope. The foliage of C. <i>arist&agrave;ta</i> is
cordate and blotched.</p>

<p><i>Cob&aelig;a sc&aacute;ndens</i>, the only species. It is a climber of
very rapid growth, has been known to grow above
two hundred feet in one summer; large bell-shaped
flowers; when they are newly expanded, they are of a
pale green colour, and change to dark purple; will
grow in the garden during summer, bearing a continual
profusion of flowers, but will not stand frost.
When this plant becomes too large in the house, do
not cut it close to the root, except there is a young
shoot arising to carry off the superabundant sap, for
the old wood will not push, which will soon cause a
mortification.</p>

<p>The best method to adopt in such case is to turn
back a shoot, and lay it in the ground to root, when it
will become a young plant; which should always be
done as soon as it appears unsightly. It does best to
be planted in the ground, but will not give any satisfaction
as to flowering in a pot. It will flower as an annual
if sown in pots this month, and placed in a warm
room or hot-bed, and planted into the garden about
the end of May.</p>

<p><i>Coron&iacute;llas</i>, a very few are fine species in the Green-house.
C. <i>gla&uacute;ca</i> is a celebrated plant amongst us, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
a free and early flowering shrub. C. <i>valent&iacute;ana</i> and C.
<i>vimin&aacute;lis</i> are equally so, flower from April to June, colour
yellow; papilionaceous flowers in clusters; agree
best with shade. In summer they ought to be kept
behind a fence, or under a tree, as the sun would destroy
them in a few weeks. Drain the pots well.</p>

<p><i>Corr&eacute;as</i>, five species, all very pretty dwarf shrubs,
and flower profusely; foliage ovate, cordate, and
either rusty or downy beneath. C. <i>&aacute;lba</i> and C. <i>r&uacute;fa</i>
have both white flowers a little tubular. C. <i>pulch&eacute;lla</i> is
a very handsome erect growing plant, flowers large
and tubular, of a deep pink colour, and grows freely:
it is thought the finest of the genus. C. <i>speci&ograve;sa</i> has
been long admired as a splendid free flowering plant;
flowers same shape as C. <i>pulch&eacute;lla</i>, but not so large;
colour red and yellowish green. C. <i>vir&egrave;ns</i> is a very free
grower, flowers same shape as the two last, colour entirely
green. These three last mentioned are abundant
flowerers, having a continued succession from November
to June, possessing the valuable requisite of
flowering through the winter, and ought to be in every
collection. They require an airy situation, and the
pots to be well drained. The plants in summer must
not be fully exposed to the sun.</p>

<p><i>Crat&agrave;gus.</i> There are none of these belonging to the
Green-house; but there is a plant in the collections,
known as C. <i>glabra</i>, which is <i>Phot&iacute;nia serrul&agrave;ta</i>, a native
of China, and is a very handsome plant, has long foliage,
deeply serrated, very shining. <i>P. arbutif&ograve;lia</i>, a native of
California, and is the finest of the genus; flowers in
large dense panicles, foliage larger than the former, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
not so deeply serrated; they are both comparatively
hardy, and we soon expect to see them acclimated.</p>

<p><i>Cupr&eacute;ssus</i> may be desired in collections, as erect and
handsome growing evergreen shrubs. C. <i>lusit&aacute;nica</i>, the
famed cedar of Goa; C. <i>p&eacute;ndula</i> and C. <i>junipero&iacute;des</i> are
the most desirable; flowers are insignificant, and yellowish;
we have no doubt they may prove hardy. C.
<i>lusit&aacute;nica</i> is the handsomest tree of the genus. Its
abundant, very long dichotomous branchlets, distinguish
it from all the evergreens of the conoferious
tribe.</p>

<p><i>Cal&aacute;mpelis sc&aacute;bra</i>, once <i>Eccremoc&aacute;rpus sc&aacute;ber</i>, is a very
fine climber, where there is a convenience to plant it in
the ground. It will flower profusely from March to November;
foliage pinnate, with tendrils; flowers from the
axils on young shoots in a kind of racemose, and of a
golden colour; grows freely.</p>

<p><i>Cel&aacute;stris</i>, staff-tree, about twenty-five species; of no
particular beauty. Some of them have numerous small
white flowers, in cymes and panicles; foliage generally
ovate, acute, and serrated. C. <i>pyrac&aacute;ntha</i>, C. <i>cym&oacute;sa</i>,
C. <i>multifl&ograve;rus</i>, and C. <i>l&uacute;cidus</i>, are the most conspicuous,
and all the genera are of easy culture.</p>

<p><i>Co&ograve;kia p&uacute;nctata</i>, Wampee-tree of China, named in
honour of the celebrated Capt. Cook. The fruit is
much esteemed in China, where it grows to about the
size of a walnut, in bunches; leaves pinnate, ovate,
lanceolate, accuminate; when rubbed, have a strong
odour; flower small white in racemose spikes, of slow
growth.</p>

<p>C. <i>allist&agrave;chys</i>. There are two of them very handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
large growing shrubs. C. <i>lanceol&agrave;ta</i> and C. <i>ov&agrave;ta</i>,
foliage silky-like, and light coloured; flowers yellow,
papilionaceous, and very abundant.</p>

<p><i>Davi&egrave;sias</i>, above ten species, principally natives of
New South Wales, all yellow papilionaceous flowers.
<i>D. ulic&igrave;na</i>, <i>D. latif&ograve;lia</i>, <i>D. acicul&agrave;ris</i>, and <i>D. inricss&agrave;ta</i>, are
very fine species, flower and grow freely, and require
to be well drained; bloom from April to August.</p>

<p><i>Di&oacute;smas</i>. This genus is now very much divided, and
only contains about thirteen species: the generas that
they have been given to, are <i>Aden&aacute;ndra</i>, <i>Barosma</i>, <i>Acmad&egrave;nia</i>,
and <i>Agath&oacute;sma</i>. We will enumerate a few of
the finest species of each. <i>D. capit&aacute;la</i>, <i>D. oppositif&oacute;lia</i>,
<i>D. longif&ograve;lia</i>, <i>D. r&ugrave;bra</i>, and <i>D. teretif&ograve;lia</i>, are the most
conspicuous, all small white flowers except <i>D. r&ugrave;bra</i>;
foliage small, and all handsome growing evergreens.</p>

<p><i>Aden&aacute;ndras</i>, eight species. This genus is the most
select of those that have been subdivided. <i>A. speci&ograve;sa</i>,
<i>A. umbell&agrave;ta</i>, <i>A. &aacute;lba</i>, <i>A. fragr&agrave;ns</i>, and <i>A. unifl&ograve;ra</i>, are
all splendid flowers: and all white except <i>A. fragr&agrave;ns</i>,
which is red. Pots must be well drained.</p>

<p><i>Bar&oacute;smas</i>, above ten species. <i>B. serratif&ograve;lia</i>, <i>B.
pulch&egrave;lla</i>, purple, <i>B. f&oelig;tid&iacute;ssima</i>, blush, <i>B. odor&agrave;ta</i>, white,
and <i>B. dio&iacute;ca</i>, pink, are the finest.</p>

<p><i>Acmad&egrave;nias</i>, five species. <i>A. lavig&agrave;ta</i>, <i>A. p&uacute;ngens</i>,
and <i>A. tetrag&ograve;nia</i>, blush, are good species.</p>

<p><i>Agath&oacute;smas</i>, above twenty-five species, many of them
very celebrated free flowering shrubby plants. <i>A. accumin&agrave;ta</i>,
<i>A. hybrida</i>, <i>A. Thunbergi&agrave;na</i>, <i>A. imbric&agrave;ta</i>, <i>A.
prol&iacute;fera</i>, <i>A. p&aacute;tula</i>, and <i>A. pulch&eacute;lla</i>, which is the finest
of the genus, the dried leaves of which the Hottentots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
use as powder to mix with the grease with which
they anoint their bodies. Some travellers assert
that it gives them so rank an odour, that they sometimes
could not bear the smell of those who were their
guides. In fact the foliage of all the five last mentioned
generas, if rubbed by the hand while on the plant, has
a very strong smell, some of them very agreeable, others
disagreeable. They are all heath-like and evergreen
small neat growing shrubs. They require while growing
luxuriantly to have their young shoots topped to make
them bushy; drain all the pots well, and keep them in
airy situations, and not crowded with other plants, or
they will become slender and unsightly.</p>

<p><i>Dry&aacute;ndras.</i> This genus is closely allied in character
and habits to <i>B&aacute;nksia</i>, and contains above sixteen
species. D. <i>n&iacute;vea</i>, has a most beautiful foliage, very
long and deeply indented. D.<i>form&ograve;sa</i>, has a scent like
the fruit of an Apricot. D. <i>nerv&ograve;sa</i>, D. <i>florib&uacute;nda</i>, D.
<i>arm&agrave;ta</i>, D. <i>plum&ograve;sa</i>, D. <i>Baxt&egrave;ri</i>, D. <i>nerv&ograve;sa</i>, and D. <i>falc&agrave;ta</i>,
are the most conspicuous, and all highly desirable
plants in collections. They are very delicate of importation;
flowers are straw and orange coloured and thistlelike.
Seeds in small cones. Treat them the same as
directed for <i>B&aacute;nksias</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dillwynias</i>, above twelve species, and plants very little
known. D. <i>florib&uacute;nda</i>, D. <i>teretif&ograve;lia</i>, and D. <i>phylicoides</i>,
are desirable plants; flowers small, papilionaceous, and
colour yellow. They are very liable to suffer from too
much wet; while dormant, therefore, the pots must be
effectually drained.</p>

<p><i>Dampi&egrave;ras</i>, four species. The genus is named in ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>nour
of Captain W. Dampier, a famous voyager, has
Lobelia-like flowers, either blue or purple. C. <i>purp&ugrave;rea</i>,
C. <i>undul&agrave;ta</i>, and C. <i>str&iacute;cta</i>, are the finest; the two former
are shrubby; the latter is herbaceous; they all flower
freely.</p>

<p><i>Edw&aacute;rdsias</i>, about four species, very beautiful foliaged
plants and have very curious yellow flowers, but do
not flower until the plant becomes large. <i>E. grandifl&ograve;ra</i>,
<i>E. chrys&ograve;phylla</i>, and <i>E. meirophylla</i>, are the best,
and are tolerably hardy, though doubtful of ever
being acclimated. The flowers are leguminose, foliage
ovate, pinnate, from eight to forty on one footstalk, and
appears to be covered with gold dust. The hardier they
are grown, the more visible it will appear.</p>

<p><i>Elichrysums</i>. This genus is now extinct, and two splendid
species of it given to others. <i>E. proliferum</i> is now
<i>Ph&aelig;n&agrave;coma prol&iacute;fera</i>, and has beautiful purple everlasting
rayed flowers, and highly esteemed: the foliage round,
ovate, smooth, and closely imbricated. <i>E. spect&aacute;bile</i> is
now <i>Aph&eacute;lexis h&ugrave;milis</i>, has pine-like foliage, and large
light purple flowers and everlasting; care must be taken
that they are not over watered; drain the pots well.</p>

<p><i>Enki&aacute;nthus</i>, only two species, both very fine. <i>E. quinquefl&ograve;rus</i>
has large ovate accuminate foliage, flowers
pink, and pendulous; very handsome. <i>E. reticul&aacute;tus</i>, the
foliage is netted, and the flowers blush; they are liable
when dormant to suffer from wet. Be sure to drain the
pots well, and sparing in water while in that state.</p>

<p><i>Ep&aacute;cris</i>, above twelve species, and all very ornamental.
<i>E. grandifl&ograve;ra</i> has been celebrated ever since it
was known; the foliage is small, flat, and accuminate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
flowers tubular and pendulous, bright crimson, with a
tinge of white, and very abundant, in flower from January
to June. <i>E. pulch&eacute;lla</i> is likewise a most beautiful plant;
foliage very small and closely set, flowers pure white, and
in long spikes, sweet-scented. <i>E. impr&eacute;ssa</i>, foliage impressed,
and flowers rose-coloured. <i>E. palud&ograve;sa</i>, flowers
white, and grows very handsomely. <i>E. purpur&aacute;scens r&ugrave;bra</i>
is a good variety, with bright red flowers. They are mostly
erect growing plants; flower from March till June, and
a rough, turfy, sandy soil is found most congenial.
They are natives of the mountainous districts of New
South Wales. The pots must be well drained; the
roots will run with avidity amongst the potshreds.</p>

<p><i>Er&igrave;cas</i>, heath. There are in cultivation in Europe
above five hundred and fifty species and varieties of
this magnificent genus. About sixty, years ago it consisted
only of a few humble British plants, with the
heath of Spain, <i>E. Mediterr&agrave;nea</i>, which is at present
most common in our collections, though in a few years
we may expect to see it supplanted by others more
splendid.</p>

<p>In their native countries, they are adapted to a
great many useful purposes. In the north of Britain,
the poorer inhabitants cover their cabins or huts with
heath, and build the walls with alternate layers of it
and a kind of cement made with straw and clay.
They likewise brew ale, and distil a hot spirit from
the tender shoots; and it has been known to be used
in dyeing, tanning, and many other useful domestic
purposes. Encomium on their beauty is not requisite;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
they are almost as diversified in colour as colour itself.
Many are graceful, and most elegant; hundreds
are pretty; a few noble and splendid; others grotesque,
curious, and odoriferous. To cultivate and propagate
them is one of the most delicate branches of horticulture.
Nevertheless, it has been said by a scientific
writer, that "those who complain of the difficulty of
growing the heath are ignorant people who have never
had a heath to grow." The most splendid collection
in Europe is under the care of Mr. M'Nab, of the
Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, where there are
two large houses devoted to their culture; and through
the whole year a continued profusion of bloom is kept
up. Some of the plants are six feet in diameter, and
twelve feet high. The soil used is a coarse sandy
peat. Pots drained with potshreds, and pieces of freestone,
are put down the sides of the large pots and tubs:
where these can be had they are essential to the culture
of mountainous plants, preventing them from
being saturated with moisture, or from becoming dry,
they being retentive of moisture, thus keeping the roots
in a medium state; for if once the roots are allowed to
get thoroughly dried, no art of the gardener can recover
them. This may be the true reason why they are
said to be difficult of cultivation.</p>

<p>In the summer season the pots must be kept out of
the sun, for in a few hours the pot would become heated,
dry the roots, and cause death, or a brownness of
foliage which would never again become natural.
Too much fire heat will hurt them. They only require
to be kept free from frost, need a great deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
air and plenty of light; consequently, should be placed
near the glass, that they may have the benefit of all
the air that is admitted. Their flowers are as varied
in shape as variety or colour, but they all partake of a
wax-like nature, and are very persistent. For the
finest and most select varieties, see the catalogue at
the end of this work.</p>

<p><i>Er&ograve;diums</i>, Heron's bill. There are about thirty species,
all of a Geranium character, and there are among them
some very pretty flowering, soft wooded, shrubby, herbaceous,
and annual plants. Only a few of them belong to
the Green-house, of which <i>E. incarn&agrave;tum</i>, <i>E. crassif&ograve;lium</i>,
and <i>E. lacini&agrave;tum</i>, are the finest; culture similar to <i>Ger&agrave;nium</i>.
The flowers of these are scarlet, pentapetalous,
and veiny.</p>

<p><i>Eucalyptus</i>, above fifty species of them, and the tallest
growing trees of New Holland; foliage very diversified,
generally of a hard glaucous texture. From their rapid
growth, they soon grow higher than the loftiest house.
The most conspicuous are <i>E. cord&agrave;ta</i>, <i>E. rostr&agrave;ta</i>, <i>E.
radi&agrave;ta</i>, <i>E. pulvig&eacute;ra</i>, <i>E. gl&ograve;bifera</i>, <i>E. pulverul&eacute;nta</i>, and <i>E.
res&iacute;nefera</i>. In Van Dieman's Land, a manufactory
has been established, where a tannin is extracted from
many of the species. The last mentioned produces
gum, like that which the druggists call <i>Kino</i>. They
ought not to be too much fostered, as it would in some
degree retard their growth. They are of a very hardy
nature. When large, the plants will flower freely, and
are similar in flower to <i>Myrtle</i>; many stamina proceeding
from a hard nut-like capsule.</p>

<p><i>Eupat&ograve;rium.</i> There is only one species deserving of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
cultivation in the Green-house; flowers syngenesious,
white, and in large flattened panicles; very sweet-scented.
The plant, when growing freely, in the beginning
of summer, should be topped, which would make it
more bushy; if not, it is apt to grow straggling. Known
as <i>E. eleg&aacute;ns</i>, in our collections.</p>

<p><i>Eut&aacute;xia's</i>, two species. <i>E. myrtif&ograve;lia</i> is a most beautiful
free-flowering evergreen shrub; foliage small, but
very neat; flowers leguminose, small, and very many;
colour yellow and red; grows freely. The young plants
should be frequently topped, or they will grow naked and
unsightly. <i>E. p&ugrave;ngens</i>, similar to the other except in
foliage. They flower from March to June, and ought
to have a place in every Green-house. Culture very
easy.</p>

<p><i>Euch&igrave;lus obcord&agrave;tus</i> is the only species: Flowers similar
to <i>Eut&agrave;xia</i>; foliage almost unique, being inverse,
cordate; time of flowering from March to June.</p>

<p><i>F&uacute;chsias</i>, Ladies' ear drop. About twelve species.
Several of them elegant and handsome shrubs. <i>F. virg&aacute;ta</i>
and <i>F. c&ograve;nica</i> are the most splendid of deciduous
Green-house shrubs; the nerves of the leaves and young
wood of the former are tinged with purplish red; the
large pendant flowers which are produced from the
axils of the leaves of the young wood continue during
the growing season. <i>F. c&ograve;nica</i> grows strong, foliage
green, flowers pendant, corolla more spreading than
the other, and when in flower is a complete mass of
scarlet blossoms. It flowers all summer. <i>F. cocc&iacute;nea</i> is
a common and celebrated plant, and deservedly so. <i>F.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
<i>microphylla</i> is a neat glowing, small flowering species.
<i>F. arb&oacute;rea</i>, has very large foliage, and rose coloured
flowers; a scarce species, but very desirable. <i>F. gr&agrave;cilis</i>
and <i>F. thymif&ograve;lia</i>, are both fine; most of the flowers
are a bright scarlet, the stamens are encircled with a
petal of bright purple, and are of very curious construction;
they bear a dark purple berry, and are of the
easiest cultivation, but during summer they must be
carefully kept in the shade.</p>

<p><i>Gels&egrave;mium n&igrave;tidum</i>, Carolina jessamine, a most beautiful
climbing evergreen, flowering shrub. In the months
of April and May, it produces many large yellow trumpet-like
blossoms of delicious fragrance. If much
fostered in growth, it will not flower so freely.</p>

<p><i>Gnaph&agrave;lium</i>, everlasting. This genus has got all the
beautiful Cape species taken out of it, and given to
<i>Ast&eacute;lma</i> and <i>Helichrysum</i>. Of <i>Ast&eacute;lma</i> there are above
ten species, most of them very splendid, everlasting
flowers. <i>A. ex&iacute;mia</i> has brilliant red flowers. <i>A. spir&agrave;lis</i>,
<i>A. specios&iacute;ssima</i>, <i>A. fr&ugrave;ticans</i>, and <i>A. imbric&agrave;tum</i>, are
all very fine; pots must be well drained.</p>

<p><i>Helychrysums</i>, above forty species, chiefly belonging
to the Green-house, all everlasting flowers. <i>H. grandifl&ograve;rum</i>,
<i>H. arb&ograve;reum</i>, <i>H. orient&agrave;le</i>, <i>H. fr&agrave;grans</i>, <i>H. adorat&igrave;ssimum</i>,
<i>H. fr&ugrave;ticans</i>, and <i>H. f&uacute;lgidum</i>, are all very
esteemed species, mostly soft white foliage. The pots
should be well drained, and the plants kept in an airy
situation, as they suffer from the least damp. If the
flowers are cut off before they fade, they will retain for
many years all the splendour of their beauty; but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
allowed to decay on the plant, they will soon become
musty, and all their colour fade.</p>

<p><i>Gomphol&ograve;biums</i>, a genus of very pretty delicate plants,
all papilionaceous; flowers generally yellow with a
little red; foliage very variable. G. <i>barb&iacute;gerum</i>, G. <i>polim&oacute;rfum</i>,
G. <i>latif&ograve;lium</i>, G. <i>grandifl&ograve;rum</i>, and G. <i>ven&uacute;stum</i>,
are fine, the pots must be well drained, and care taken
that they are not over watered; they grow freely.</p>

<p><i>Gen&iacute;stas</i>: a few of these are very pretty free flowering
shrubs. G. <i>canari&eacute;nsis</i>, G. <i>tricuspid&aacute;ta</i>, G. <i>cuspid&ograve;sa</i>, and
G. <i>umbell&agrave;ta</i>, are the finest Green-house species. All
of them have yellow leguminose flowers in great abundance;
leaves small, lanceolate.</p>

<p><i>Gn&iacute;dias</i>, about ten species of pretty Green-house
shrubs. G. <i>s&iacute;mplex</i>, G. <i>ser&iacute;cea</i>, G. <i>imb&eacute;rbis</i>, and G. <i>pinif&ograve;lia</i>,
flower the most freely; flowers straw colour, tubular,
and corymbose. G. <i>s&iacute;mplex</i> is sweet-scented, leaves
small; the pots must be well drained, and care taken
that they do not get either too wet or too dry, for the
roots are very delicate. The plants must be kept near
the glass, or they will be drawn weak.</p>

<p><i>Good&egrave;nia</i>, a genus of about twelve species, with cordate,
serate, alternate foliage. G. <i>stell&iacute;gera</i>, and G. <i>su&aacute;veolens</i>
are sweet-scented; G. <i>ov&agrave;ta</i> and G. <i>grandifl&ograve;ra</i> are the
best. They are principally small shrubs, with terminale
or axillary flowers, and flower during summer.</p>

<p><i>Gort&egrave;ria person&agrave;ta</i> is the only species that belongs to
this genus, and is an annual. There are several plants
in our collections known as <i>Gort&egrave;rias</i>, but which properly
are <i>Gaz&agrave;nia</i>, of which there are five species. G.
<i>r&igrave;ngens</i>, when the flowers are fully expanded, (which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
will only be while exposed to the sun, closing at night,
and opening again with the influence of the sun's rays,)
is a great beauty. The rays of the flowers are bright
orange, and the centre dark purple. <i>G. pav&oacute;nia</i> has
handsome foliage; flower similar to <i>G. r&igrave;ngens</i>, except
the centre of the flower being spotted, and is thought
to be the finest, but does not flower so freely. <i>G. heterophylla</i>
is of the same character, except the foliage,
which is variable, the colour orange and vermilion.
They are half shrubby dwarf growing plants, and during
the months of July, August, and September, are liable
to damp off at the surface of the earth, from the action
of heat, and too much water. Pots must be well drained,
and the plants kept partially in the shade. Their
flowers are syngenesious, and about two inches in
diameter.</p>

<p><i>Grev&iacute;lleas</i>, about thirty species. A few of them very
handsome in flower and foliage, among which are <i>G.
pun&iacute;cea</i>; <i>G. acanthif&ograve;lia</i>, (beautiful foliage); <i>G. conc&iacute;nna</i>,
very pretty straw and rose-coloured flowers; <i>G. juniper&igrave;na</i>,
green and straw-coloured; <i>G. line&agrave;ris</i>, white
flowers. The flowers of the whole are curious, though
not very attractive. Some carry their flowers in racemose
spikes, others on flowering branches, which are
recurved; the petals are very small and rugged; the
stile longer than the appendage. They grow freely,
flower and ripen seeds; all evergreen dwarf shrubs.</p>

<p><i>H&agrave;keas</i>, about forty species, not generally so interesting
or attractive as the last genus; flowers all
white; construction similar to <i>Grev&iacute;llea</i>, but the foliage
more varied. <i>H. gibb&ograve;sa</i>, <i>H. n&iacute;tida</i>, <i>H. sal&iacute;gna</i>, <i>H. sua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>v&egrave;olens</i>,
sweet-scented, <i>H. concul&agrave;ta</i>, and <i>H. lamb&eacute;rti</i>, are
the best, and afford a curious variety of foliage;
flower in June. Drain the pots well.</p>

<p><i>Hemeroc&aacute;llis</i>, Day Lily. Only <i>H. speci&ograve;sa</i> of this
genus belongs to the Green-house; the flower is spacious,
and of copper colour. A native of Jamaica. It
has not found its way into our collections. It is herbaceous,
and while growing requires much water. The
plant known with us as <i>H. jap&oacute;nica</i> is now <i>F&uacute;nkia &aacute;lba</i>,
(and justly, for the most superficial observer could
have distinguished it as not belonging to <i>Hemeroc&aacute;llis</i>.)
It requires to be much fostered to flower well, and
plenty of water. If properly treated, it is a magnificent
flower, and continues flowering from July to September.
We doubt not it may prove a hardy herbaceous
plant, (the same as <i>F. c&aelig;r&ugrave;lea</i>,) if protected during the
first winter.</p>

<p><i>Herm&aacute;nnias</i>, a genus of about forty species, all natives
of the Cape of Good Hope, and not worth cultivating.
They have yellow cup-like flowers, and are of
the easiest cultivation. Several species are in our collections.</p>

<p><i>Hibb&eacute;rtias</i>, about ten species. Three of them are
very fine climbing evergreen shrubs, viz. <i>H. glossulari&aelig;f&ograve;lia</i>;
<i>H. dent&agrave;ta</i>; <i>H. vol&ugrave;bilis</i>, if closely approached
has a disagreeable smell; <i>H. fascicul&agrave;ta</i>, <i>H. sal&iacute;gna</i>,
and H. <i>peduncul&agrave;ta</i>, are evergreen shrubs; they have
pure yellow flowers of five petals, blooming from May
to September.</p>

<p><i>Habr&aacute;nthus</i>, about ten species of small South American
bulbs, nearly allied to <i>Amaryllis</i>. H. <i>Anders&oacute;nii</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
H. <i>vers&iacute;color</i>, and H. <i>rob&uacute;sta</i> are the finest; they are in
colour yellow, blue, and lilac. We have very little
doubt but these bulbs will do to plant out in the garden
in April, and be lifted in October. Keep them
from frost. Thus treated, they are very desirable
bulbs.</p>

<p><i>H&ograve;veas</i>, about eight species, pretty plants of New
South Wales, blue pea-flowering evergreen shrubs;
the finest are H. <i>line&agrave;ris</i>, H. <i>rosmarinif&ograve;lia</i>, H. <i>longif&ograve;lia</i>,
and H. <i>C&eacute;lsii</i>, which is the most superb, and flowers in
abundance. They grow and flower freely; the pots
should be drained.</p>

<p><i>Hydr&aacute;ngea hort&eacute;nsis</i> is a well known plant, and much
esteemed for its great profusion of very elegant, though
monstrous, flowers. They are naturally of a rose colour,
but under certain circumstances of culture they
become blue. If grown in brown loam with a little
sand, they will preserve their original colour; but if
grown in swamp earth with a little mould of decayed
leaves, they will become blue. The swamp earth and
vegetable mould being more combined with aluminous
salt than brown loam, is the cause of the change; and,
when first found out, (which was merely by chance,)
was thought a great wonder. It must have a very
plentiful supply of water when in flower, which is produced
on the shoots of the previous year. They will
neither grow nor flower well if they are not kept constantly
in the shade. When kept in the sun, the foliage
is very brown; and by being neglected in watering,
we have seen the flowers completely scourged. Being
tolerably hardy, when the winters are mild, by a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
protection in the open air, they will flower profusely;
the flowers will be very large, and in bloom from June
to October. They are deciduous, soft wooded shrubs.</p>

<p><i>Hyp&eacute;ricums</i>, St. John's wort, about twenty species.
A few of them are very showy, and with few exceptions
have yellow flowers. <i>H. mon&oacute;gynum</i>, H. <i>balearicum</i>,
H. <i>florib&uacute;ndum</i>, H. <i>canari&eacute;nse</i>, H. <i>&aelig;gypt&igrave;acum</i>, and
H. <i>cochinchinense</i>, which has scarlet flowers, are amongst
the best, and all of them flower freely; five petals, filaments
many in three or five parcels. They are all of
very easy cultivation, and bloom generally from April
to September.</p>

<p><i>Ilex</i>, Holly, of <i>I. aquif&ograve;lium</i>. There are above one
hundred species of them in cultivation in Europe, differing
in variegation, margin, shape, and size of the
leaves; some are only prickly on the margin of the foliage,
others prickly over all the surface. In Europe
they are all hardy, but with us few or none of the varieties
are so. If they become acclimated, they will be a
great ornament to our gardens, being all low evergreen
shrubs. The most common and conspicuous varieties
are the <i>hedgehog</i>, <i>striped hedgehog</i>, <i>white edged</i>, <i>gold edged</i>,
and <i>painted</i>; the flowers are white and small, berries
yellow or red; they do not agree with exposure to the
sun. <i>J. Cass&iacute;ne</i> and <i>J. vomit&ograve;ria</i> have very bitter
leaves, and, though natives of Carolina, we have to give
them the protection of a Green-house. It is said that
at certain seasons of the year the Indians make a strong
decoction of the leaves, which makes them vomit freely,
and after drinking and vomiting for a few days, they
consider themselves sufficiently purified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ill&iacute;ciums</i>, Aniseed-tree, three species. <i>I. florid&agrave;num</i>,
has very sweet-scented, double purple flowers, and the
plant grows freely and systematically if properly treated,
and deserves the attention of the admirers of flowers.
<i>I. parvifl&ograve;rum</i> has small yellow flowers; <i>I. anis&agrave;tum</i> is so
very like <i>I. parvifl&ograve;rum</i> in every respect, as to make us
conclude they are the same, were <i>I. anis&aacute;tum</i> not a native
of China, and the other two natives of Florida.
When the leaves and capsules of either of them are
rubbed, they have a very strong smell of anise;&mdash;they
grow very freely.</p>

<p><i>Indig&oacute;fera</i>; Indigo-tree, about twenty species, belong
to the Green-house, and are chiefly pretty free flowering
shrubs. <i>I. denud&agrave;ta</i>, <i>I. am&aelig;na</i>, <i>I. austr&agrave;lis</i>, <i>I. angul&agrave;ta</i>,
<i>I. c&agrave;ndicans</i>, and <i>I. filif&ograve;lia</i>, are very fine; flowers papilionaceous,
in long panicles; colour various, red, blue,
yellow, and pink.</p>

<p><i>Isop&ograve;gons</i>, about ten species of <i>Pr&ograve;tea</i>-like plants, all
natives of New Holland. They are very stiff shrubs,
with leaves very much divided, and cone-like flowers
at the extremity of the shoots. <i>I. form&ograve;sus</i>, <i>I. anemonif&ograve;lius</i>,
<i>I. attenu&agrave;tis</i>, and <i>I. polyc&eacute;phalis</i>, are the finest;
flowers are straw, lilac, white, and yellow coloured;
the pots must be well drained, and the plants not over-crowded.</p>

<p><i>Just&iacute;cias.</i> Only a few of these belong to the Green-house,
and are very simple looking flowers. The most
beautiful of them belong to the Hot-house. <i>J. n&igrave;gricans</i>,
small striped flower; <i>J. orchio&iacute;des</i> and <i>J. Adh&aacute;toda</i>, Malanut,
are the only ones that are worth observation,
and are very easily cultivated. <i>J. Adh&aacute;toda</i> has good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
looking foliage, but does not flower until the plant becomes
large; colour white and light purple.</p>

<p><i>Jacks&ograve;nias.</i> A genus consisting of five species.
The foliage is varied, and all natives of New South
Wales. <i>J. scop&agrave;ria</i> is similar to a plant in our collections,
called <i>Vimen&agrave;ria denudata</i>. <i>J. h&oacute;rrida</i>, and <i>J. reticul&agrave;ta</i>,
are the finest; the small flowers come out of the
young shoots, are yellow and papilionaceous; the pots
should be well drained.</p>

<p><i>Kenn&egrave;dias</i>, about nine species, all evergreen climbers,
of the easiest culture, and flower abundantly. <i>K. monophylla</i>,
blue flowered, and <i>K. rubic&uacute;nda</i>, crimson flowered,
are common in our collections. <i>K. prostr&agrave;ta</i>, (once
<i>Glycine cocc&iacute;nea</i>) one-flowered scarlet, and <i>K. cocc&iacute;nea</i>,
many flowered scarlet, are very pretty. <i>K. Comptoni&agrave;na</i>
has splendid purple flowers, and <i>K. inophylla</i> is
thought the most superb. It is very rare, and we have
not seen it flower. They are large purple. The
pots should be well drained; and if the plants are
much fostered, they will not flower so well; flowers are
either in racemose spikes, or solitary, which is rather
too much distinction for the same genus.</p>

<p><i>Lamb&eacute;rtias</i>, four species of very fine plants, natives
of New Holland. L. <i>form&ograve;sa</i> is the finest of the genus
that we have seen; flowers large and of a splendid rose
colour. L. <i>echin&agrave;ta</i> is said to be finer, but has not flowered
in cultivation. L. <i>unifl&ograve;ra</i> has single red flowers, and
L. <i>in&eacute;rmis</i> orange coloured. They are rare plants in
the collections on this side of the Atlantic. Drain the
pots well; the foliage is narrow, and of a hard dry nature.</p>

<p><i>Lasiop&egrave;talums</i>, only two species. There were a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
more, but they are now <i>Thom&agrave;sias</i>, plants of no merit
whatever, in regard to flower; foliage three lobed, small,
rough, and rusty-like. <i>Thom&agrave;sia solan&agrave;cea</i> and <i>T. quereif&ograve;lia</i>,
are the best species; foliage of the former is
large, cordate, and deep indented; they are all of the
easiest culture.</p>

<p><i>Lav&aacute;ndulas</i>, Lavender, about seven species belong to
the Green-house, and a few of them very pretty soft-wooded,
half shrubby plants, and if touched, are highly
scented. L. <i>dent&agrave;ta</i> has narrow serrated foliage, very
neat. <i>L. form&ograve;sa</i> and <i>L. pinn&agrave;ta</i> are desirable; blue flowers
on a long spike; should be kept near the glass; they
are of the easiest culture.</p>

<p><i>La&uacute;rus.</i> A few species are Green-house plants.
This genus has been divided to <i>Cinnam&ograve;mum</i>; still
there are a few celebrated plants in the original. L.
<i>n&ograve;bilis</i>, sweet bay, though hardy, is kept under protection.
It will bear the winter with a little straw covering,
notwithstanding there should be a plant kept in
the house in case of accident by frost or otherwise;
there is a variegated variety of it. <i>L. &iacute;ndica</i>, royal bay,
<i>L. f&oelig;tens</i>, <i>L. aggreg&agrave;ta</i>, and <i>L. gl&uacute;aca</i>, are favourites.
There is a species known in our collections as <i>L. sc&aacute;bra</i>.
The Camphire tree, known as <i>L. camph&ograve;ra</i>, is
<i>Cinnam&ograve;mum camph&ograve;ra</i>; the wood, leaves, and roots
of this tree have a very strong odour of camphire. It
is obtained by distillation from the roots and small
branches, which are cut into chips, and put into a net
suspended within an iron pot, the bottom of which is
covered with water, having an earthen head fitted in it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
heat is then applied, and the steam of the boiling water
acting upon the contents of the net, elevates the camphire
into the capital, where it concretes on the straws,
with which this part of the apparatus is lined. They
are all fine evergreens, (which the name denotes,) and
easily cultivated,</p>

<p><i>L&igrave;nums</i>, Flax, two or three species are very fine,
and flower freely. <i>L. trigynum</i> has large yellow
flowers in clusters, and <i>L. ascyrifôlium</i>, whose flowers
are large, blue, and white, and in long spikes. The
shape of them is very like the flower vulgarly called
Morning-glory.</p>

<p><i>Lob&egrave;lias.</i> Several of them when well treated, form
most magnificent flowering plants; they are principally
herbaceous. L. <i>T&ugrave;pa</i> has the largest foliage, and fine
scarlet flowers. L. <i>speciôsa</i>, flowers light purple; L.
<i>f&uacute;lgens</i>, crimson flowers; L. <i>spl&eacute;ndens</i>, scarlet flowers.
The three last are of the same habit; the colours brilliant;
and to grow them well, they should be divided,
(if there are several shoots arising,) when they begin
to grow, putting them first into four inch pots, and
shifting them frequently, having them to flower in
those of nine or ten inches, which will be about the
end of June, or first of July, and they will continue
until October. The pots must be always kept in pans
or saucers filled with water; likewise give plenty to
the surface of the earth, which is to be done during
their time of growth and flowering. If this is attended
to, they will produce flower stalks from four to six feet
in height, and covered with branches and spikes of
flowers from bottom to top. The corolla is pentape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>talous,
three down and two up; they require a little
shade. The genus consists of about eighty species;
seventy of them are exotics; many of them natives of
the Cape of Good Hope, with little flowers of brilliant
colours. L. <i>c&aelig;r&ugrave;lea</i>, L. <i>Thunb&eacute;rgii</i>, L. <i>corymbôsa</i>, L.
<i>pyramid&agrave;lis</i>, and L. <i>ilicif&ograve;lia</i>, are very fine species, of
weak growth, but flower freely.</p>

<p><i>Lom&agrave;tias</i>, about six species; flowers are white or
straw colour, and similar to <i>Grev&iacute;llea</i>, but the foliage
more handsome.</p>

<p><i>Lophosp&eacute;rmum sc&aacute;ndens.</i> This is a magnificent new
climbing soft wooded shrub, with purple, campanulate
flowers, which are produced from the axils on the
young wood; they bloom from May to September;
leaves large, cordate, and tomentose; grows rapidly,
and flowers abundantly.</p>

<p><i>Lachn&aelig;as</i>, about five species, remarkable for their
downy heads of white flowers; leaves small, ovate, lanceolate.
L. <i>gla&ugrave;ca</i>, L. <i>conglomer&agrave;ta</i>, and L. <i>erioc&eacute;phala</i>,
are the best species. The pots must be well drained,
and in summer the plants protected from the sun.</p>

<p><i>Leon&ograve;tis</i>, Lion's-ear, four species. They have very
fine scarlet tubular flowers, orifice-toothed. They
come out in large whorls, and look elegant; but neither
plant nor foliage has an agreeable appearance.
They are of the easiest culture. L. <i>interm&eacute;dia</i>, and
L. <i>Leon&ugrave;rus</i>, are the best flowering species.</p>

<p><i>Leucosp&eacute;rmums</i>, about eighteen species, of Proteacious
plants, chiefly low growing, and are mostly downy
or hairy; flowers yellow, in terminale heads. L. <i>form&oacute;sum</i>,
L. <i>grandifl&ograve;rum</i>, L. <i>toment&oacute;sum</i>, and L. <i>candi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>cans</i>,
rose-scented. These are fine species. For treatment,
see <i>Pr&ograve;teas</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lip&agrave;rias</i>, about five species, much esteemed for
their beauty of foliage; leaves ovate, lanceolate, downy
or woolly; flowers yellow, leguminose, and capitate.
L. <i>sph&aelig;rica</i>, L. <i>toment&oacute;sa</i>, L. <i>vill&oacute;sa</i>, and L. <i>ser&iacute;cea</i>, are
the finest. L. <i>vist&igrave;ta</i> and L. <i>vill&oacute;sa</i> are the same, although
put in many catalogues as different species.
None of them ought to be much watered over the
foliage, as it adheres to the down, and causes the
young shoots to damp off. Drain the pots well, and
keep the plants in an airy situation.</p>

<p><i>Lysin&egrave;mas</i>, four species, closely allied to <i>Ep&aacute;cris</i>.
In every respect treatment the same. L. <i>pentap&iacute;talum</i>,
L. <i>conspicum</i>, and L. <i>r&ograve;seum</i>, are the best; the flowers
of the two former are white. L. <i>silaif&ograve;lia</i> has leaves
bipinnatifid and smooth, segments wedge-shaped and
cut. L. <i>dent&agrave;ta</i> and L. <i>ilicif&ograve;lia</i> are the finest; the pots
should be drained.</p>

<p><i>Lon&iacute;cera jap&oacute;nica.</i> There is a plant in our collections
known by that name, which is now <i>Nintooa longifl&agrave;ra</i>;
flowers of a straw colour, but come out white.
It has been known to withstand the winter, but does
not flower, and is frequently killed entirely.</p>

<p><i>Lychnis coro&agrave;ta</i>, is an esteemed Chinese plant;
flowers-in abundance, pentapetalous, large, and a little
indented at the edges; colour a red-like orange; flowers
terminale and axillary. The roots must be divided
every spring, or they will dwindle away to nothing.
Perhaps a good method of treatment would be to divide
the roots, and plant them in the garden; they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
flower well, and could be lifted in the fall, and put under
protection. We have no doubt that it may become
acclimated. If not done so, plant them in four inch
pots, and repot them into those of six inch in May. Do
not expose them while in flower to the mid-day sun, for
it will deteriorate the fine colour.</p>

<p><i>Leptosp&eacute;rmums</i>, about thirty species, all pretty New
Holland evergreen dwarf shrubs, with small white
flowers. L. <i>bacc&agrave;tum</i>, L. <i>p&eacute;ndulum</i>, L. <i>jun&iacute;perinum</i>, L. <i>ov&aacute;tum</i>,
L. <i>stell&agrave;tum</i>, L. <i>grandifl&oacute;rum</i>, and L. <i>scop&agrave;rium</i>, are the
best of the species. The latter was used as tea by
Capt. Cook's ship's crew. It is an agreeable bitter,
with a pleasant flavour, when fresh. When young
plants are growing, they ought to be frequently topped
to make them bushy, and kept in an airy situation, or
they will be drawn and unsightly. They are of very
easy culture.</p>

<p><i>Leucad&eacute;ndrons</i>, Silver tree, above forty species, all natives
of Cape of Good Hope. They are evergreens with
handsome, silvery-like foliage. L. <i>argent&eacute;um</i> (once
<i>Pr&ograve;tea argent&eacute;a</i>) is a great beauty; foliage white,
lanceolate, and silky. It is a plant that has been long
in cultivation, greatly admired, and much sought for,
and is the finest of the genus. L. <i>squarr&ograve;sum</i>, L. <i>stell&agrave;tum</i>,
(once <i>Pr&ograve;tea stellaris</i>) L. <i>t&oacute;rtum</i>, L. <i>serv&iacute;ceum</i>, L.
<i>marg&igrave;n&agrave;tum</i>, and L. <i>plumôsum</i> (once <i>P. parvifl&ograve;ra</i>) are all
fine species. The pots must be well drained, and the
plants never over-watered. They are very desirable
in collections for their beauty of foliage; flowers similar
to <i>Pr&ograve;tea</i>.</p>

<p><i>Magn&ograve;lias.</i> There are four species that require the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
protection of our Green-houses; all the others are
hardy. M. <i>fusc&agrave;ta</i>, and M. <i>annon&aelig;f&ograve;lia</i>, are very similar
in foliage and flower: the young branches and leaves
of M. <i>fusc&agrave;ta</i> is covered with a brown, rusty-like down;
the other by some is considered merely a variety;
flowers small, brown, and very sweet-scented. M.
<i>p&ugrave;mila</i> is very dwarf growing; leaves large and netted;
flowers semi-double, white, pendant, and fragrant. They
are natives of China. We have several others from
the east, but being deciduous are perfectly hardy. M.
<i>odorat&iacute;ssima</i>, now <i>Tal&agrave;uma Cand&oacute;lii</i>, a native of the
Island of Java, and said to be very odoriferous, but is
very rare even in Europe; said to have a straw coloured
flower. M. <i>consp&iacute;cua</i> is desirable to have in the
Green-house, if enarched on a stock of M. <i>purp&ugrave;rea</i>,
which will always keep it dwarf, and it will flower magnificently
in February and March.</p>

<p><i>Melal&egrave;ucas</i>, above thirty species, and a beautiful
genus of New Holland plants, of easy culture; flowers
come out of the wood like fringes. M. <i>el&iacute;ptica</i>, M. <i>f&uacute;lgens</i>,
scarlet, M. <i>decuss&agrave;ta</i>, M. <i>hypericif&ograve;lia</i>, M. <i>squarr&ograve;sa</i>,
M. <i>linarif&ograve;lia</i>, M. <i>incana</i>, M. <i>tetrag&ograve;nia</i>, M. <i>thymif&ograve;lia</i>,
are all very fine species, and flower freely if they
have been grown from cuttings; the singularity of flower
and diversity of foliage make them generally thought of.</p>

<p><i>Maur&aacute;ndias</i>, three species, of very pretty climbing
Green-house plants, flowering from March to
October. M. <i>Barcl&agrave;yana</i> has splendid flowers, large,
light blue, campanulate, and very abundant. M. <i>semperfl&ograve;rens</i>
has rose coloured flowers, of the same character.
They will flower best if planted in the ground.</p>

<p><i>Myrs&iacute;nes</i>, Cape Myrtle, dwarf cape evergreen shrubs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
covered with small flowers from March to May. M. <i>ret&ugrave;sa</i>
has green and purple flowers; M. <i>rotundif&ograve;lia</i>,
flowers white and purple. They will grow in any situation,
and are of easy culture.</p>

<p><i>M&eacute;spilus jap&oacute;nica.</i> The plant, known under that
name, is now <i>Eriab&ograve;trya jap&oacute;nica</i>, Loquat, is a fine plant
with large lanceolate, distantly serrated leaves, white
underneath; small white flowers on a racemose spike,
and produces a fruit about the size of a walnut, of a
fine yellow blush colour, and of delicious flavour. If it
flowers in the fall, it will require the heat of a Hot-house
to ripen the fruit. It is of very easy culture, and its
noble aspect is never passed unobserved.</p>

<p><i>Metrosid&egrave;ros</i>, about five species. Many have been
added to <i>Callist&egrave;mon</i>. M. <i>fl&ograve;rida</i>, M. <i>umbellata</i>, and M.
<i>angustif&ograve;lia</i>, are the best species. C. <i>sal&iacute;gnum</i>, C. <i>lanceol&agrave;tum</i>,
variety <i>semperifl&ograve;rens</i>, C. <i>gla&ugrave;cum</i>, once M. <i>speci&ograve;sa</i>,
has splendid scarlet flowers and C. <i>form&ograve;sum</i>;
these are all beautiful plants, with scarlet flowers. Other
two beautiful species with white flowers have been given
to <i>Ang&oacute;phora</i>. A. <i>cordif&ograve;lia</i>, once M. <i>h&iacute;spida</i>, and A.
<i>lanceol&agrave;ta</i>, once M. <i>cost&agrave;ta</i>; these genera are very easily
distinguished from any other Australasian shrubs, by
the peculiar character of having both sides of the
leaves alike. The flowers consist of stamens, stiles,
and anthers, coming in hundreds out of the young wood
for the length of three or four inches, forming a dense
cone crowned with a small twig; leaving capsules in
the wood, which will keep their seeds perfect for a
great number of years. They grow freely, and the pots
should be well drained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Myrtus</i>, Myrtle, is a well known and popular shrub,
especially the common varieties; and was a great favourite,
(even to adoration,) among the ancients. It
was the mark of authority for Athenian rulers, and is
amongst the moderns an emblem of pre-eminence.
They are elegant evergreen shrubs, with an agreeable
odour. M. <i>comm&ugrave;nis multipl&eacute;x</i>, double flowering, is a
very neat shrub, and flowers abundantly. M. <i>comm&ugrave;nis
leucoc&aacute;rpa</i>, White-fruited Myrtle, is quite unique,
when the berries are on it. M. <i>it&aacute;lica variag&aacute;ta</i>, striped
leaved; M. <i>it&aacute;lica macul&agrave;ta</i>, blotch leaved, are very fine
shrubs; and M. <i>toment&ograve;sa</i>, Chinese Myrtle, is a magnificent
erect growing shrub, with a white down over the
foliage; the flowers are the largest of the genus. When
they first expand, they are white, and afterwards change
to purple, so that there are beautiful flowers of several
shades of colour on the plant. We have not the smallest
doubt but this species will become in many instances
as plentiful as the common myrtle. It is more
easily grown, but cannot stand much exposure to the
sun in summer. M. <i>tenuif&ograve;lia</i> is a very fine plant, and
a native of New South Wales. Myrtles in general
should be sprinkled with water in the evenings, to keep
off mildew and red spider.</p>

<p><i>Nand&igrave;na dom&eacute;stica</i>, the only species, and a popular
shrub in the gardens of Japan, where it is called <i>Nandin</i>.
It has supra-decompound leaves, with entire lanceolate
leaflets, a kind of foliage that is very rare; the
flowers are small, whitish green, in panicles, succeeded
by berries of the size of a pea; drain the pots well.</p>

<p><i>N&egrave;rium</i>, (Oleander,) is a genus of beautiful erect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
growing evergreen shrubs, of the easiest culture, and
abundant in flower. <i>N. ole&aacute;nder</i> is the common rose
coloured single flowering species, from which six varieties
have originated. At present the most popular is
<i>N. ole&aacute;nder spl&egrave;ndens</i>, which has a double rose coloured
flower. There is one that has got in our collections
as double white which is only semi-double. We have
seen a white, variety as double as <i>N. o. spl&egrave;ndens</i>, and
have no doubt but in a few years it will be plentiful.
<i>N. ole&aacute;nder elegant&igrave;ssimum</i>, a most beautiful plant, with
deep silver-edged foliage; and the young wood is striped
white and green. We are not positive in respect to
the beauty of its flowers, but it has a high character.
We have heard of a double-yellow variety, but the reports
are not properly authenticated; and we doubt it
very much. There are likewise single yellow, single
white, and single blotched varieties of <i>N. ole&aacute;nder</i>. They
are subject to the small white scaly insect, and should
be frequently washed, as has been directed, to keep it
off.</p>

<p><i>Oleas</i>, Olive, about twelve species and varieties.
<i>O. Europ&aelig;a longif&ograve;lia</i>, is the species that is cultivated
to such an extent in the south of France, and Italy. <i>O.
Europ&aelig;a latif&ograve;lia</i> is chiefly cultivated in Spain. The
fruit is larger than that of Italy, but the oil is not so
pleasant, which is obtained by crushing the fruit to a
paste, and pressing it through a woollen bag, adding
hot water as long as any oil is yielded. The oil is then
skimmed off the water, and put into barrels, bottles,
&amp;c. for use. The tree seldom exceeds thirty feet, and
is a branchy glaucous evergreen, and said to be of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
longevity. Some plantations at Turin in Italy are supposed
to have existed from the time of Pliny. It frequently
flowers in our collections, but seldom carries
fruit; flowers white, in small racemose axillary spikes.
<i>O. cup&eacute;nsis</i> has a thick large oblong foliage; flowers
white, in large terminale panicles. <i>O. verruc&ograve;sa</i>, foliage
flat, lanceolate, and white beneath, branches curiously
warted. <i>O. fragr&aacute;ns</i>, foliage and blossoms are both
highly odoriferous; the plant is much esteemed in
China, and is said to be used to adulterate and flavour
teas. Leaves are elliptic, lanceolate, and a little serrated;
flowers white in lateral bunches. It is subject
to the small, white scaly insect, and ought to be carefully
kept from them by washing. <i>O. paniculata</i> is a
fine species. They are all very easily cultivated.</p>

<p><i>Oxyl&ograve;biums</i>, seven species, plants very similar to
<i>Callistachys</i>, with ovate, cordate, light coloured, pubescent
foliage, with papilionaceous flowers. <i>O. obtusif&ograve;lium</i>
has scarlet flowers; <i>O. ret&ugrave;sum</i>, orange flowers;
and <i>O. ell&iacute;pticum</i>, yellow flowers. They grow freely,
and should be well drained; flower from May to August.</p>

<p><i>Pelarg&ograve;niums</i>, Stork's Bill. This genus, so universally
known amongst us as <i>Ger&agrave;nium</i>, from which it was
separated many years ago, is a family of great extent
and variety, for which we are principally indebted to
the Cape of Good Hope. By cultivation from seed
many hundred beautiful species and well marked varieties
have been obtained. There are about five hundred
species, with upwards of two hundred varieties.
They are of every character, colour and shade, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
most vivid description. The easy cultivation of the
<i>Pelarg&ograve;nium</i> tribe, or <i>Ger&agrave;niums</i>, as they are commonly
called, has rendered them very popular; also the
agreeableness of scent and fragrance of which many of
them are possessed, makes them favourites. If their
flowering season was of longer duration, the varieties
and species would be quite indispensable in collections;
but there is every appearance that in a few years the
aspect of them will be changed. The present prevailing
colour of the flower, (which has five petals, three
hanging and two erect, the erect petals being always
of the darkest shade,) is a white or pink ground, with
lilac, purple, or pink stripes, flakes, or spots, and
blooms from April to June; though they bloom profusely
in large bunches, the time is limited. The species
and varieties that have a red ground, with black
or dark crimson stripes or spots, generally bloom during
the whole summer. These, though scarce in the
collections of the country, will in a few years root out
those whose flowers are of such short duration, and
by their blooms charm us half of the year.</p>

<p>The tuberous and fleshy stemmed species are far
more interesting to the discriminating inquirer than
the common kinds. Their habit and constitution are
so peculiar, that we have frequently wondered that
they have not been separated into distinct genera.
The cultivation of them is more difficult, water being
very prejudicial to them when they are inactive.
When they are well managed, they flower beautifully,
and the colours are very superior and peculiar, having
frequently bright green and purple in the same flower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
If some of the colours of these could be compounded
with the large flowering kinds, those hybridised would
be magnificent.</p>

<p>The best method to adopt in impregnating these, is
to choose the female, one that has large flowers, of
easy cultivation, and as nearly allied in character and
other habits as possible. When a flower of the intended
female is newly expanded, take a pair of very fine
pointed scissors, and cut off the anthers before the
pollen expands; then as soon as the summit of the stile
divides, apply the pollen taken from the anthers of the
intended male plant on a very fine camel hair pencil,
or cut out the stigma entirely, and place the anther on
the summit of the stile, which, if correctly done, will
have the desired effect. As soon as the seed is ripe,
sow it in light sandy soil; and when it has come up,
take care not to over-water the soil, which would
cause them to damp off. When they are about one
inch high, put them into small pots, and treat as the
other varieties. Have them all distinctly marked until
they flower, which will be in the second year from the
time of sowing.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oacute;rmium t&egrave;nax</i>, New Zealand flax lily, the only species;
foliage resembling an <i>Iris</i>, and very thready. In
New Zealand and Norfolk Island, the natives manufacture
from this plant a kind of stuff like coarse linen,
cordage, &amp;c.; the plant is very hardy, and we would
be no way surprised to see it stand the severity of our
winters. It bears exposure to the open air in Europe
in the 56th degree of north latitude. The flowers are
said to be yellow and lily-like; of the easiest culture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Phylicas</i>, above twenty-five species. Several of them
are very pretty growing evergreen shrubs, and of easy
culture. P. <i>horizont&agrave;lis</i>, P. <i>squarr&ograve;sa</i>, P. <i>imbric&agrave;ta</i>, P.
<i>myrtif&ograve;lia</i>, P. <i>call&ograve;sa</i>, P. <i>b&iacute;color</i>, and P. <i>erico&iacute;des</i>, are all
neat growing; flowers small, white, in heads; drain
the pots well, and keep them in an airy situation.
The foliage of several of the species is downy.</p>

<p><i>Pim&egrave;leas</i>, about fourteen species. Most of them are
highly esteemed, and are not often seen in our collections.
P. <i>decuss&agrave;ta</i> is the finest of the genus, both in
foliage and flowers, which are red, and in large terminale
clusters; P. <i>rôsea</i>, P. <i>linif&ograve;lia</i>, white, P. <i>spic&agrave;ta</i>,
and P. <i>drup&agrave;cea</i>, are all fine species. The latter has
the largest foliage, which is ovate and accuminate;
berry-bearing. They should be well drained. They
are very small evergreen shrubs, with white or red
flowers.</p>

<p><i>Pitt&oacute;sporums</i>, about nine species, with handsome
foliage, and small white flowers in clusters, which are
fragrant. P. <i>Tob&igrave;ra</i> is a native of China, and nearly
hardy; leaves lucid, obovate, obtuse, and smooth. P.
<i>undul&agrave;tum</i>, P. <i>cori&agrave;ceum</i>, P. <i>revol&ugrave;tum</i>, P. <i>f&uacute;lvum</i>, and
P. <i>ferrug&iacute;neum</i>, are very ornamental evergreens, and
will grow with the most simple treatment.</p>

<p><i>Platyl&ograve;biums</i>, Flat Pea, four species of fine free
flowering plants; flowers leguminose; colour yellow.
P. <i>form&ograve;sum</i>, P. <i>or&agrave;tum</i>, and P. <i>triangul&agrave;re</i>, are the
best; the foliage of the two former is cordate, ovate;
the latter hastate, with spiny angles.</p>

<p><i>Pist&agrave;cias</i>, seven species of trees, principally of the
south of Europe. There is nothing particular in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
appearance, except their productions in their native
country. P. <i>tereb&iacute;nthus</i> is deciduous, and produces
the Cyprus turpentine. P. <i>lent&iacute;scus</i> is the true mastich
tree, which is obtained by cutting transverse incisions
in the bark. P. <i>v&egrave;ra</i> and P. <i>reticul&agrave;ta</i> are good
species; leaves pinnated; leaflets ovate, lanceolate;
easily cultivated.</p>

<p><i>Plumb&agrave;gos</i>, Lead-wort. There are only two species
of any consequence belonging to the Green-house, P.
<i>tr&iacute;stis</i> and P. <i>cap&eacute;nsis</i>. The former is a shy flowerer,
but the latter flowers freely; colour beautiful light blue,
and flowers in spikes; foliage oblong, entire, and a
little glaucous; of very easy culture, and continues in
bloom a considerable time.</p>

<p><i>Psor&agrave;leas</i>, above forty species. A few of them are
worthy of cultivation, P. <i>odorat&iacute;ssima</i>, P. <i>spic&agrave;ta</i>, P.
<i>acule&agrave;ta</i>, P. <i>arg&eacute;ntea</i>, and P. <i>toment&ograve;sa</i>. They have all
blue flowers, and leguminose. They are chiefly low
shrubs; and will flower and grow freely; the pots require
draining.</p>

<p><i>Podalyrias</i>, about fourteen species of pretty Cape
shrubs; foliage oblong, obovate, and silky-like; the
flowers leguminose; colour blue or pink. P. <i>ser&iacute;cea</i>,
P. <i>styracif&ograve;lia</i>, P. <i>cor&uacute;scans</i>, P. <i>arg&eacute;ntea</i>, P. <i>lipario&iacute;des</i>,
and P. <i>subbifl&ograve;ra</i>, are the finest and most distinct species,
and flower abundantly.</p>

<p><i>Petso&oacute;nias</i>, about sixteen species of dwarf evergreen
shrubs; leaves oblong, or lanceolate, hairy, or downy;
flowers axillary and solitary; the pots should be well
drained, and the plants in summer protected from the
sun. P. <i>hirs&ugrave;ta</i>, P. <i>m&oacute;llis</i>, P. <i>teretif&ograve;lia</i>, and P. <i>l&ugrave;cida</i>,
are the most distinct, and grow freely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pr&ograve;teas</i>, about forty-four species. The foliage of
this genus is very diversified; flowers very large, terminale;
stamens protected by an involucrum; many-leaved
and imbricated; which is very persistent. P.
<i>cynaro&iacute;des</i> has the largest flower, which is purple,
green, and red. P. <i>speci&ograve;sa</i>, P. <i>umbon&agrave;lis</i>, once P.
<i>longif&ograve;lia</i>, P. <i>melale&ugrave;ca</i>, P. <i>grandifl&ograve;ra</i>, P. <i>cocc&iacute;nea</i>, P.
<i>cenoc&aacute;rpa</i>, P. <i>p&aacute;llens</i>, P. <i>form&ograve;sa</i>, P. <i>magn&iacute;fica</i>, P. <i>speci&ograve;sa
r&uacute;bra</i>, and P. <i>mell&iacute;fera</i>, will afford a very good
variety. It is almost impossible to describe their true
colour, it being so various; red, white, straw, brown,
green, and purple, are most predominant, and frequently
to be seen in the same flower; the plants must
be well drained; and during warm weather be careful
that they are not neglected in water, for if they are
suffered to droop, they seldom recover. For this reason
the pots ought not to stand in the strong sun; the
plants can bear it, but to the roots it is injurious.</p>

<p><i>Pulten&aelig;as</i>, about forty species, pretty little dwarf
growing shrubs of New South Wales; flowers small,
leguminose, all yellow, with a little red outside of the
petals. P. <i>vill&ograve;sa</i>, P. <i>obcord&agrave;ta</i>, P. <i>arg&eacute;ntea</i>, P. <i>plum&ograve;sa</i>,
P. <i>fl&eacute;xilis</i>, shining leaved, fragrant; P. <i>c&aacute;ndida</i>, and P.
<i>str&igrave;cta</i>, are all fine species, and esteemed in collections.
The leaves are all small; they require an airy exposure,
and the pots drained.</p>

<p><i>Rhodod&eacute;ndrons</i> (Rose tree), a magnificent genus, and
contains some of the most superb and gigantic plants
that adorn the Green-house. All the <i>Az&agrave;leas</i> (except
A. <i>proc&uacute;mbens</i>) both Chinese and American, have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
arranged under this genus. At present the most admired
is <i>R. arb&ograve;reum</i>, with varieties. <i>R. arb&ograve;reum</i> has
deep scarlet flowers, with dark spots and flakes campanulated,
and in large clusters; leaves lanceolate,
acute, rough, and silvery beneath. <i>R. arb&ograve;reum alb&uacute;m</i>
is very rare. <i>R. arb&ograve;reum sup&eacute;rbum</i>, flowers same
shape as <i>arb&ograve;reum</i>, colour bright scarlet; foliage one
third larger, but not silvery beneath; grows freely, and
generally thought the finest variety. <i>R. arb&ograve;rea &aacute;lte-Cl&agrave;rance</i>
is also very superb. There are several other
varieties of minor note. A Green-house without some of
the scarlet varieties of that plant, is deficient of a flower
whose beauty and grandeur are beyond the highest
imagination. It is a native of Nepaul in India, and
when found by Dr. Wallach awakened the ambition of
every cultivator and connoisseur in Europe. There are
several other species brought from that country lately,
but none of them has yet flowered. They are highly
valued from the productions of the above; the species
are <i>R. campanul&agrave;tum</i>, <i>R. anthop&ograve;gon</i>, and <i>R. cinnam&ograve;meum</i>.
This is named from the colour of the leaves,
which are very peculiar and very handsome; the
flowers are said to be rose-coloured. These three last
cannot be purchased under an immense price; the
others have been rarely seen in our collections, but another
year or two will make them more plentiful. Their
beauty of flower is beyond description. The pots
should be well drained, and if they are large, put several
pieces of sandy stones or potshreds around the side, for
the fine fibres delight to twine about such, being mountainous
plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ro&eacute;llas</i>, pretty leafy shrubs, with blue terminale funnel-shaped
flowers, lip-spreading; <i>R. cilli&agrave;ta</i>, <i>R. spic&agrave;ta</i>,
and <i>R. peduncul&agrave;ta</i>, are the finest of the genus.
The pots must be well drained, and care taken that
they are not over-watered.</p>

<p><i>S&aacute;lvia</i> (Sage), is an extensive genus of soft-wooded,
shrubby, or herbaceous plants; very few of them do
well in the Green-house, and many of them are very
trifling, having no other attraction than the flower, and
those of the tender species, when compared with <i>S.
&eacute;legans</i>, <i>S. spl&eacute;ndens</i>, <i>S. c&aelig;r&uacute;lea</i>, and <i>S. cocc&igrave;nea</i>, (which
in artificial climates constitute the standard of the
genus,) are not worth cultivation. These last mentioned,
if kept in the Green-house, will merely keep in
life, but a situation in the Hot-house would cause
them to flower frequently. The best method to adopt
with the summer flowering kinds, is to plant them in
the garden in May; they will grow strong and flower
abundantly, and in the fall they can be lifted, and preserved
during winter in pots. They neither grow nor
flower so well as when planted out, and even a slip planted
in the ground in moist weather will root in a few
days, grow, and flower in a few weeks. <i>S. spl&eacute;ndens</i> is
the best to select for the purpose. <i>S. a&ugrave;rea</i>, <i>S. panicul&agrave;ta</i>,
and <i>S. &iacute;ndica</i>, are fine species. The latter is white
and blue, with large leaves; flowers monopetalous, and
irregular; colour generally red or blue in spiked whorls.
All will grow easily with encouragement.</p>

<p><i>Sen&egrave;cios.</i> Some species of this genus are pestiferous
weeds all over the world. They are found near the
limits of perpetual snow, where neither tree nor shrub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
is able to rear its head. Yet there are three species
that are neat little plants, and are worthy of a situation,
viz. <i>S. grandifl&ograve;rus</i>, <i>S. ven&uacute;stus</i>, and <i>S. ciner&aacute;scens</i>, with
the double white and red variety of <i>S. &eacute;legans</i>. The
two last varieties are free flowering, but if allowed to
grow several years, they become unsightly. Being very
easily propagated, a few cuttings of them should be put
in, in September, and in two weeks they will strike root,
when they may be put in pots to keep through the
winter, and then planted in the garden, continuing to
renew them. The other mentioned species should be
frequently done the same way. Do not keep them damp
during winter, or they will rot off. Keep them in an
airy exposure.</p>

<p><i>Sch&oacute;tias</i>, a beautiful genus of six species, which will
require the warmest part of the Green-house to keep
them. The foliage is handsome; leaves compound:
leaflets oval-lanceolate, and in pairs from six to ten; <i>S.
speci&ograve;sa</i>, crimson, flowers nearly papilionaceous, and in
bunches, the most superb of the genus. <i>S. al&agrave;ta</i>, <i>S. latif&ograve;lia</i>,
once <i>Omphal&ograve;bium Sch&oacute;tia</i>, and <i>S. tamarindif&oacute;lia</i>, are
the finest; the flowers of the others are red. The pots
require to be drained, and the plants protected from
the hot sun.</p>

<p><i>Swains&ograve;nas</i>, four species of free flowering, soft wooded
shrubs, natives of New South Wales. <i>S. galigif&ograve;lia</i>,
<i>S. coronill&aelig;f&ograve;lia</i>, and <i>S. astragalif&ograve;lia</i>, are red, purple,
and white; leguminose flowers in spikes from the axils,
are of easy culture, and deserving of a situation; the
foliage is pinnate; leaflets ovate, acute.</p>

<p><i>Sc&ograve;ttias</i>, three species of valuable plants; <i>S. dent&agrave;ta</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
with scarlet leguminose blossoms; leaves opposite,
ovate, accuminate, serrate; <i>S. angustif&ograve;lia</i> has brown
flowers; <i>S. trapezif&ograve;rmus</i>, leaves ovate, acute, serrulate.
We do not know the colour of its flowers; the pots
must be well drained, and the plants kept in the warmest
part of the Green-house, and near the light.</p>

<p><i>Sparrm&aacute;nnias</i>, are strong growing Green-house
shrubs. <i>S. afric&agrave;na</i>, is a plant very common in our
collections, with large three lobed cordate leaves, hairs
on both sides; flowers from March to July. <i>S. rug&oacute;sa.</i>
The leaves are rugged; flowers of both are
white, in a kind of corymb, supported by a long footstalk;
buds drooping, flowers erect. There is a plant
known in our collections, as the free-flowering <i>Sparrm&aacute;nnia</i>,
(which is <i>Ent&egrave;lia arbor&eacute;scens</i>,) and is easily distinguished
from <i>Sparrm&aacute;nnia</i> by the leaves being cordate,
accuminate, and otherwise, by all its filaments
being fertile, and the flowers more branching, and
blooming from November to June, profusely; very easily
cultivated, and desirable.</p>

<p><i>Sph&aelig;rol&ograve;biums</i>, only two species of leafless plants,
with yellow and red leguminose flowers, which proceed
from the young shoots. <i>S. vim&iacute;neum</i> and <i>S. m&eacute;dium</i>.
They flower freely, and are easily cultivated. The old
wood should be frequently cut out where it is practicable.
Drain the pots.</p>

<p><i>Spreng&eacute;lia incarn&agrave;ta</i>,, the only species, a very pretty
plant, allied to <i>Ep&agrave;cris</i>; small foliage, long, accuminate;
flowers small, pink, bearded, and in close spikes; grows
freely, delighting in shade. The pots must be well
drained, and the plants, when dormant, watered spa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>ringly,
for if they get sodden about the roots, they very
seldom recover.</p>

<p><i>Stylid&iacute;ums</i>, six species of pretty litte plants, with
small linear leaves, and remarkable for the singular
elasticity of the style or column, which, when the flower
is newly expanded, lays to one side, and on being
touched with a pin starts with violence to the opposite
side. S. <i>graminif&ograve;lium</i>, S. <i>frutic&ograve;sum</i>, S. <i>laricif&ograve;lium</i>, and
S. <i>adn&agrave;tum</i>, are all free flowering; flowers in spikes,
very small; colour light and dark pink; blooms from
April to July. S. <i>adn&agrave;tum</i> is half herbaceous, and
should, when growing, be kept nigh the glass, or it will
be drawn, and the flowers become of a pale colour.
They are all of easy cultivation.</p>

<p><i>Styph&egrave;lias</i>, seven species of very showy flowers, with
mucronate leaves; corolla in a long tubular form, having
several bundles of hairs in it; segments reflex and
bearded. <i>S. tubifl&ograve;ra</i>, crimson, <i>S. trifl&ograve;ra</i>, crimson and
green; <i>S. adsc&eacute;ndens</i>, and <i>S. longif&ograve;lia</i>, are beautiful
species. They grow freely, and should be well drained,
as too much water is very hurtful to them. In summer
they ought not to be much exposed to the hot sun, or
the foliage will become brown.</p>

<p><i>Salpigl&oacute;ssis</i>, four species of fine herbaceous Green-house
plants, natives of Chili. The flowers are tubular
and campanulate. <i>S. p&iacute;cta</i>, flowers white and blue
painted; <i>S. atropurp&ugrave;rea</i>, flowers dark purple, and <i>S.
isnu&agrave;ta</i>, flowers crimson, are superb, and if planted in
the garden during summer will flower profusely. They
must be lifted in October, and taken under protection.</p>

<p><i>Tag&egrave;tes l&ugrave;cida</i> is found in many of our collections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
The leaves are simple, oblong, and finely serrated.
When rubbed by the hand, they have an agreeable fragrance;
the flowers are syngenesious, small, and in terminale
bunches. It is herbaceous; and when about an
inch grown should be divided and potted into five inch
pots. Repot it again about the first of June. It keeps
in flower from July to November.</p>

<p><i>Testudin&agrave;ria</i>, Elephant's foot, or Hottentot's bread,
two species remarkable for their appearance. The
root or bulb, if it may be so called, is of a conical shape,
and divided into transverse sections. Those of one
foot diameter are computed to be 150 years of age. It
is a climbing herbaceous plant, with entire reniforme
leaves of no beauty; flowers small; colour green. The
pots must be well drained, for when the plant is inactive
it is in danger of suffering from moisture, and ought
not to get any water. <i>T. Eleph&aacute;ntiphes</i> and <i>T. mont&agrave;na</i>
are the species, natives of the Cape of Good Hope,
and require the warmest part of the house.</p>

<p><i>T&aacute;xus nuc&iacute;fera</i>, is the only species that requires protection,
and bears a small acorn; flowers are trifling;
an evergreen, with ovate, lanceolate foliage, thickly set
on the wood; will grow in any situation. There is a
plant in our collections known as <i>T. chin&eacute;nsis</i> or <i>T. elong&aacute;ta</i>,
which is <i>Podoc&aacute;rpus elong&agrave;tus</i>. It has lanceolate
leaves, erect growing, and very hardy; flowers m&oelig;onacious,
and of no estimation except to the curious.</p>

<p><i>Telop&egrave;a specios&iacute;ssimus</i>, is the only species, and was
once called <i>Emb&oacute;thrium specios&iacute;ssimus</i>. It is now called
<i>Telop&egrave;a</i> in allusion to the brilliant crimson flowers, which
from their great size are seen at a large distance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
which render it one of the most conspicuous productions
of New South Wales. The leaves are oblong,
deeply toothed, veiny, and smooth; wood strong;
flower ovate, connate, and terminale, and of considerable
duration. There ought to be a specimen of it in
every collection. The pots must be well drained, and
the plant in the extreme heat of summer not too much
exposed to the sun.</p>

<p><i>Templet&ograve;nia</i>, a very pretty genus, containing only
two species. <i>T. ret&ugrave;sa</i> is an erect growing shrub, with
wedge-shaped green leaves. <i>T. gl&aacute;uca</i>, leaves glacuous,
blunt, and a little apiculate; flowers of both scarlet.
They are leguminose plants of free growth, and should
be well drained; blooming from April to June.</p>

<p><i>Trist&agrave;nias</i>, seven species of evergreen shrubs. Several
of them require to be very large before they flower.
<i>T. neriif&ograve;lia</i> is a very neat little plant, and flowers abundantly;
colour yellow; shape star-like, and in clusters;
leaves lanceolate and opposite. <i>T. conf&eacute;rta</i>, white
flowers in spikes, leaves alternate. <i>T. suav&egrave;olens</i>, sweet-scented;
flowers yellow. They are all of very easy
culture.</p>

<p><i>Verb&eacute;nas.</i> A few of these are showy, herbaceous, Green-house
plants. <i>V. cham&aelig;dryf&ograve;lia</i>, lately known as <i>V. Mel&iacute;ndres</i>,
is a beautiful plant of a procumbent habit; flowers
brilliant scarlet, in glomerated heads from the axils of the
young shoots; blooming from April to October. A large
plant will appear as a solid mass of scarlet. <i>V. lamb&eacute;rtii</i>
and <i>V. pulch&eacute;lla</i> are also very pretty; colour, rose and lilac.
A very good method of treating these plants, is, to plant
them in the garden in April; and give them copious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
waterings in dry weather, and they will flower profusely,
lifting some of the plants before frost, to preserve
them during winter. They ought to be allowed to run
according to their nature; for if tied up, they will not
do so well, being in that way too much exposed.
There is a plant known in our collections as <i>Verb&eacute;na
triphylla</i>, which is <i>Aloysia citriod&ograve;ra</i>. The flowers are
in long spikes, very small, and pale purple. The celebrity
of the plant is in the foliage, which is linear, lanceolate,
ternate, and it has the most agreeable fragrance
in the vegetable world. It is of very easy culture, and
has been known to survive the winter, in open air, in
Philadelphia. It is deciduous, and would do to plant in
the garden during summer, lifting it again before frost,
and putting it under protection through winter. When
large before it begins to grow, in spring cut it into a
neat shape or form.</p>

<p><i>Vib&uacute;rnums.</i> A few of these are very ornamental evergreen
shrubs, and almost hardy. <i>V. t&igrave;nus</i> is the well
known Laurestine, (or what is commonly called Laurestinus,)
is of the easiest culture; flowers small white,
and in large flattened panicles; blooming from February
to May, and universally esteemed. It will stand
the winter by a little protection, but the flower buds
being formed in the fall, the intense frost destroys them;
consequently, it will not flower except by the buds,
which sometimes form early in summer. <i>V. l&ugrave;cidum</i> is
a good species, and superior in flower and foliage to
the former, but does not flower so freely, when the
plants are small. When they grow large, they
flower profusely. There is a desirable variegated va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>riety.
<i>V. odorat&iacute;ssimum</i> has smooth evergreen, oblong,
elliptic, distantly toothed, leaves, and frequently a stripe
in them, is sweet-scented, and a free flowerer. <i>V. hirs&uacute;tum</i>
has flowers similar to the above; foliage ovate,
with rough brown hairs on both sides, and very characteristic.
<i>V. str&iacute;ctum variag&agrave;tum</i> is a very fine variety,
and upright growing. These plants are all very desirable,
blooming early in spring, and continuing for several
months; all easily cultivated.</p>

<p><i>Vimin&agrave;ria denud&agrave;ta</i>, the only species. This plant is remarkable
for its twiggy appearance, but it has no foliage,
except when growing from seed. It has at the extremity
of the twigs or shoots, an ovate, lanceolate, leaf, disappearing
when the plant grows old; the flowers are small,
yellow, coming out of the young shoots, to the astonishment
of the beholder. It grows freely.</p>

<p><i>Virg&iacute;lia cap&egrave;nsis</i> is a beautiful cape shrub, with a
compound leaf of twenty-five leaflets, ovate, lanceolate,
edges hairy; flowers in spikes at the axils; colour blue
and leguminose. The pots require to be well drained,
and the plants protected from the sun.</p>

<p><i>Volkam&egrave;ria jap&oacute;nica.</i> There is a plant known in our
collections under that name, which is <i>Clerod&eacute;ndron fr&agrave;grans
m&uacute;ltiplex</i>. It keeps in a good Green-house, and
flowers well, frequently blooming during winter, and if
planted in the garden during summer, will flower superbly.
The flowers have a delicious fragrance; but
if the foliage is rubbed with the hand, the smell is not
so pleasant. The leaves are large, round, ovate, and
tomentose; flowers corymbose, compact, and terminale.
There are several fine plants in <i>Clerod&eacute;ndron</i> belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to the Hot-house. This plant will not bear much fumigation.</p>

<p><i>Wits&egrave;nias</i>, four species. <i>W. corymb&ograve;sa</i> is a plant that
has stood in high estimation ever since it was known,
but unfortunately there is a very inferior plant, <i>Arist&egrave;a
cy&agrave;nea</i>, got into our collections under that name. The
panicles of <i>W. corymb&ograve;sa</i> is quite smooth; those of <i>Arist&egrave;a</i>
are hairy, which is itself sufficient to detect them;
but otherwise the appearance of <i>W. corymb&ograve;sa</i> is much
stronger, and more erect growing, not inclining to
push at the roots so much as <i>Arist&egrave;a</i>. The foliage is
lanceolate and amplexicaule, the leaves having much
the nature and appearance of <i>Iris</i>. The plant is of
easy culture, and blooms from November to April; colour
fine blue. The true one has come into the
country lately. <i>W. ram&ograve;sa</i> is a very fine species, similar
to the above; flowers yellow and blue; plant
branching.</p>

<p><i>Westr&iacute;ngias</i>, a genus of four species, very like the
common <i>Rosemary</i>. <i>W. rosmarinif&oacute;rmis</i>, leaves lanceolate,
and silvery beneath; <i>W. longif&ograve;lia</i> is similar; both
have small white silvery flowers, and are easily cultivated.</p>

<p><i>Z&agrave;mias</i>, about twenty species, eight of which belong
to this compartment. The foliage is greatly admired,
and is in large fronds, with oblique, lanceolate leaflets.
Several of them glaucous. It bears heads of flowers
of a brown colour in the centre of the plant, very like
large pine cones. <i>Z. h&oacute;rrida</i>, the finest, <i>Z. p&uacute;ngens</i>, <i>Z.
sp&iacute;ralis</i>, and <i>Z. latif&ograve;lia</i>, are the most conspicuous.
They must be kept in the warmest part of the Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>-house;
and give them large well drained pots. They
are imported from the Cape of Good Hope. All the
plants herein named requiring to be drained. In preparing
the pots, place first a piece of broken pot, or
any similar substitute, with the convex side on the
hole of the pot, and then put in a few, or a handful,
(according to the size of the pot,) of shivers of broken
pots, or round gravel, about the size of garden pease.
Those that we have mentioned in this <i>Repotting</i>, as to
be done in this, or beginning of next month, is not intended
to apply to plants in general, large and small,
but to those that are young, and require encouragement,
or to those that were not shifted last autumn.
The roots must not be disturbed, but the ball turned
out entire; and put as much earth as will raise the ball
within about an inch of the rim of the pot. Press the
earth down around it with a thin-narrow piece of
wood, frequently shaking it that no vacancy may be
left. If the roots are rotten, or otherwise injured, take
all such off. If this be the case, the plant will be sickly.
Give it a new pot of a smaller size, administering
water moderately until there are visible signs of fresh
growth. The plants must not be disturbed while
flowering; let the repotting be done afterwards. Plants
are, at certain stages of growth, if in good health, in
such a state that no one can err in shifting them when
desirous to hasten their growth. Those plants that
make two or more growths during the summer may be
repotted in the interim of any of these growths, and all
others just before they begin to push in the spring;
that is, when the wood buds are perceptibly swelled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Never saturate with water fresh potted plants. There
are many kinds that, without injury, could be repotted
when growing; but it requires an experienced operator
to decide. It would be of no material service to enumerate
them here. When done potting, tie all up
neatly with stakes rather higher than the plant, that
the new shoots may be tied thereto during their stage
of growth, to prevent them from being destroyed by
the wind. There may be many that do not require repotting,
but would be benefited by a top-dressing.
This should be done by probing off all the surface
earth down to the roots, replacing it with fresh compost,
suitable to the nature of the plant.</p>

<p>When the above is done, arrange all the plants in proper
order, and syringe them clean; but if there are any
of the Green-fly, they must be fumigated previous to
syringing. Take an opportunity, on the first fine day,
to wash out all the pavement of the house, which should
be made dry before the evening if the nights are cold.
Thus every part of the house will be in order before
the hurry of the garden commences.</p>


<h4>OF ENARCHING OR GRAFTING BY APPROACH, <i>also termed</i>
ABLACTATION.</h4>

<p>In this method of grafting, the scion is not separated
from the parent plant until it is firmly united with the
stock; consequently, they must stand contiguously.
We intend the following method to apply directly to
<i>Cam&eacute;llias</i>, as they are the principal plants in the Green-house
that are thus worked. The criterion for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
operation is, just as the plants begin to grow, either in
spring or mid-summer. Place the stock contiguous to
the plant where the graft or enarch is to be taken from.
If the branches, where the intended union is to take
place, do not grow at equal heights, a slight stage may
be erected to elevate the pot that holds the lower.
Take the branch that is to be enarched, (the wood of
last or previous year is the most proper,) and bring it
in contact with the stock; mark the parts where they
are to unite, so as to form a pointed arch. In that part
of the branch which is to rest against the stock, pare
off the bark and part of the wood to about two or three
inches in length, and in the side of the stock which is
to receive the graft, do the same, that the inside rind
of each may be exactly opposite, which is the first part
where a union will take place. Bind them firmly and
neatly together with strands of Russia matting, and
protect the joint from the air by a coat of close composition;
clay of the consistency of thick paint, turpentine,
or wax, will equally answer. Finish by fastening
the grafted branch to the head of the stock or a
rod. Many practitioners make a slit or tongue into
the enarch and stock, but we find it unnecessary, more
tedious, and likewise more danger in breaking. <i>Cam&eacute;llias</i>
are also grafted, and budded, but these two operations
require great experience and continued attention,
and seldom prove so successful as enarching.
When they have perfectly taken, which will be after
the first growth is over, begin to separate them by cutting
the scion a little at three different periods, about
a week apart, separating it at the third time. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
head is intended to be taken off the stock, do it in like
manner after the second growth is over. By the above
method, many kinds can be grown on the same stock.
The same plan applies to all evergreens.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Flower_Garden2" id="Flower_Garden2"><span class="antiqua">Flower Garden.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>MARCH.</i></h3>


<p>It is expected that all the pruning is finished. If not,
get all expeditiously done, according to directions given
in the preceding months, likewise all digging, and that
which was dug in the autumn, point over, or half dig,
that all may have a neat appearance. This must not
be done when the ground is too much imbibed with
moisture, as that would harden the soil. Break it well
with the spade, leaving it one or two days before the
surface is raked smooth, that all may be ready to receive
the seeds or plants that are intended to be sown
or planted. As soon as the frost is entirely gone, uncover
all plants or shrubs that have been protected;
preserving carefully such articles as will answer
the same purpose next year. The frost disappears
generally from the middle to the end of this month. Cut
off all decayed shoots, or such as have been hurt by
the frost. The <i>Lagerstr&aelig;mias</i> will flower in greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
perfection if they are cut closely; that is, where the
wood of last year is cut to within a few eyes of the
wood of the previous year, at the same time having
regard to the shape that the plant is required to
take. Cut off the injured part of any of the evergreens
that have had their foliage much injured by the severity
of winter, leaving the part that is green, which is essential
to the support of these kinds of plants.</p>

<p>Such work as can be done in this month, should not
be delayed, such as hoeing, digging, raking, and clearing
away all decayed leaves, and litter of every description
that have been brought or blown in the garden,
during autumn or winter.</p>


<h4>BOX EDGINGS</h4>

<p>May be planted any time this month, or beginning of
next, which in most seasons will be preferable. We
will give a few simple directions how to accomplish the
work. In the first place, dig over the ground deeply
where the edging is intended to be planted, breaking
the soil fine, and keeping it to a proper height, viz.
about one inch higher than the side of the walk; but
the taste of the operator will best decide according to
the situation. Rake the surface even, and tread it
down with the feet, or beat it with the spade. Where
it gives most, continue to add, keeping the surface
at the desired height. If the edging is to be in a direct
line, either on a level or inclined plane, you may be
correctly and simply regulated by making the desired
level at each end of the line. Take three rods about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
four feet long each, having a piece of one foot to cross
at one end, two of these pieces painted black, the
other white. Have a black one at each end of the
line on the level, take the white one for the centre,
going along the line, and about every twenty feet, level
a spot to the exact height, which will be seen by looking
over the top of the rods from one end. Having
found the level, drive in a peg to it, so that no mistake
may occur; beat and level between them, leaving a
smooth surface. This being done, strain the line, and
with the spade proceed to cut out the trench perpendicularly
on the side next the walk, six, eight, ten, or
twelve inches deep, according to the length of the
plants. Afterwards take the plants, and cut the tops
even, with the knife or shears, at the same time
shortening the roots. Then with the left hand next the
line, plant forward, keeping the tops of the plants level,
and from one to two inches above ground, keeping the
plants close according to the required thickness. Put
in the earth as you proceed, and tread it firm, then rake
the surface even, and with the spade beat it smooth.
If the weather sets in very dry, the box will be the
better of a few waterings. Sometimes boxwood is
planted without roots, but it seldom gives satisfaction;
not growing equally.</p>


<h4>TENDER ANNUALS.</h4>

<p>When it is wished to have any of these flower early,
if they were not sown as directed last month, on a hotbed,
let it be done early in this. Those that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
sown and now growing freely, must have plenty of air.
In fine days the sashes may be taken off a few hours
about mid-day; and where the plants are too thick, thin
them out a few inches apart, that the air may circulate
amongst them. Have another bed ready to transplant
them into about the end of this or beginning of next
month. When transplanted, sprinkle them with water,
and shade them with mats from the sun, one or two
days. By this treatment they will be much stronger
for planting into the borders, about the first of May.
For the different kinds, see list.</p>


<h4>HARDY ANNUALS</h4>

<p>May be sown in the borders about the end of the
month, when the ground is prepared, and the weather
fine, but avoid it at all times if the earth will not pulverise
properly. The neatest and most expeditious
method is to take a rod about one foot long, and one
inch in diameter, rounding at the end, with which end
draw a circle of nine inches diameter, from one inch
to one eighth of an inch deep, according to the size of
the seeds. Many very small seeds will grow best if
sown on the surface of fine mould. When sown, cover
in with the back of the rake, placing a small twig, or a
tally with the name, in the centre of the circle, to prevent
mistakes, either in sowing, planting, or hoeing. When
they come above ground, the first moist day should be
taken to pull up such as are too crowded. Annuals
are generally too delicate to bear transplanting, therefore
they ought always to be sown where they are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>tended
to remain. A few kinds do best with removing,
such as Balsam, Mary-gold, China Aster, Stockgilly,
and several others of a free growing, strong-wooded
nature. Annuals are such plants as grow from seed,
flower, and perfect their productions, and then die,
within one year. For hardy sorts, see list. Sow in
rows or fancy spots the varieties of sweet pea.</p>


<h4>BIENNIALS</h4>

<p>Are such as are of two years' duration. Being sown
this year they flower, seed, or fruit next year, and soon
after decay. The seeds should be sown about the end
of this or beginning of next month, either in the spot
where they are intended to remain, or in a compartment
by themselves, regularly marked, and transplanted when
convenient. When they appear above ground, thin
them out distinctly, that when they are to be removed,
a little earth may adhere to them; and if put where they
are to stand, leave only three plants.</p>


<h4>PERENNIALS.</h4>

<p>In every Flower-garden there ought to be a good
selection of these plants. They are lasting ornaments,
and when judiciously selected, will give yearly gratification.
In making a choice, a view should be had to
have those that flower abundantly, are of free growth,
beauty, and continuation of flower. It would go beyond
our limits, to give an extensive description of any, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
a few remarks on some of the finest, with their names,
are indispensable.</p>

<p><i>Ad&ograve;nis vern&aacute;lis</i>, is a fine border flower, and will grow
in any common soil; flowers large, yellow rayed, having
in the rays about twelve petals; leaves much divided,
bloom in April and May.</p>

<p><i>Anem&oacute;ne</i>, Wind-flower. Several fine species, with
flowers from one to three inches in diameter. <i>A. Hall&egrave;ri</i>,
blue; <i>A. pulsat&igrave;lla</i>, blue pasque flower; <i>A. alp&igrave;na</i>,
large white. These are fine plants, and are now given
to a genus called <i>Pulsat&igrave;lla</i>. <i>A. palm&agrave;ta fl&ograve;re-pl&egrave;no</i>, yellow;
<i>A. stell&agrave;ta vers&iacute;color</i>, various coloured; <i>A. pavon&igrave;na fl&ograve;re-pl&egrave;no</i>,
scarlet; <i>A. narcissifl&ograve;ra</i>, white. Any of these are
very desirable.</p>

<p><i>Antirrh&igrave;nums</i>, Snap-dragon. All the varieties of <i>A.
m&agrave;jus</i> are esteemed in the flower borders; the pure
white and bright red are very showy. A few of the
species, <i>A. m&oacute;lle</i> and <i>A. s&iacute;culum</i>, where there is variety
required, deserve a situation. The flowers are all
large, and similar to the snout of an animal.</p>

<p><i>Ascl&egrave;pias.</i> The finest of this genus are native plants,
and are highly esteemed in Europe, but frequently rejected
with us, because "they are wild plants." <i>A. tuber&ograve;sa</i>
has beautiful orange flowers, and delight in dry
situations. <i>A. r&ugrave;bra</i>, <i>A. n&iacute;vea</i>, <i>A. purpur&aacute;scens</i>; and
<i>A. incarn&agrave;ta</i>, are the finest of the family. It is best to
plant <i>A. tuber&ograve;sa</i> in October.</p>

<p><i>Acon&iacute;tums</i>, Wolfs'-bane, one hundred and twenty-eight
distinct species, with several varieties. Many of
them are of consequence and beauty; the flower stems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
rise from one and a half to six feet upright, and strong,
furnished with many palmate and digitate leaves, terminated
by spikes of blue, yellow, or white flowers,
similar to a hood; hence the name of Monk's Hood is
often applied to them. They are scarce in collections,
but in a few years we have no doubt but many of them
will be plentiful. The finest species are <i>A. speci&ograve;sum</i>,
<i>A. anth&ograve;ra</i>, <i>A. ne&uacute;rbergensis</i>, <i>A. am&aelig;num</i>, <i>A. nap&eacute;llus</i>,
<i>A. ven&uacute;stum</i>, <i>A. zo&oacute;ctonum</i>, <i>A. pyramid&agrave;le</i>, <i>A. lyc&oacute;ctonum</i>,
<i>A. alb&ugrave;m</i>, and <i>A. vers&iacute;color</i>. They flower from May
to September, and will grow in any common garden
soil. The roots of <i>A. nap&eacute;llus</i> are like small
turnips, and are said to be poisonous.</p>

<p><i>C&aacute;ltha pal&uacute;stris fl&ograve;re-pl&egrave;no</i> is a good border plant, delights
in moist situations, has large cordate, crenated
leaves; flowers double yellow; blooming from April till
June; and is a desirable plant.</p>

<p><i>B&eacute;llis per&eacute;nnis hort&eacute;nsis</i>, Daisy. We might almost
say with another, "every one knows the Daisy." It is
named from being pretty, and is perfectly hardy,
though generally kept under cover. They delight to
have a shaded situation during summer, to protect
them from the sun, which, as it were, scorches the
roots. There are many double varieties in the gardens,
which flower early. The one called <i>Crown</i>, or
<i>Carnation</i> Daisy, is twice the size of the common varieties,
and has white and red petals alternately, and very
double. Loamy soil, inclined to moisture, is best
adapted to their growth.</p>

<p><i>Camp&aacute;nulas.</i> This genus affords many very orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>mental
plants for the Flower-garden and Shrubbery,
and they flower superbly during the summer, agreeing
better with our climate than with that of Europe. Several
have two successions of flowers, <i>C. persicif&ograve;lia
&aacute;lba pl&egrave;na</i>; <i>C. persicif&ograve;lia c&aelig;r&ugrave;lea pl&egrave;no</i>; <i>C. urticif&ograve;lia</i>,
white. Of this last there is also a double variety. <i>C.
speci&ograve;sa</i>; <i>C. glomerata</i>; <i>C. vers&iacute;color</i>; with several others,
are worthy of a situation in every garden. Their roots
are strong, fleshy, and fibrous. They are easy of culture,
and will retain their situation in the severest of
our winters. <i>C. grandifl&ograve;ra</i> is now <i>Wahlenb&eacute;rgia grandifl&ograve;ra</i>.
It has fine blue large flowers; the flower stems
are slender, and should be supported as soon as they
grow.</p>

<p><i>Cheir&aacute;nthus Ch&eacute;iri vulg&agrave;ris</i> is the common garden
Wall-flower. There are about ten varieties of it, all
admired for their various colours and agreeable odour.
The common variety survives the mildest of our winters.
The most esteemed variety is <i>H&aelig;m&aacute;nthus</i>, Double
bloody. They should all be protected by a frame.
<i>C. mut&aacute;bilis</i> is a beautiful species; it has many shades
of colour from lilac to dark purple. The flowers are
on extending racemose spikes; blooming from April to
June; it requires a light rich soil; is a half shrubby
evergreen plant.</p>

<p><i>Chel&ograve;nes.</i> This genus belongs entirely to this continent,
and possesses many fine species. It is a matter
of astonishment that they are not more cultivated and
sought for in our collections. <i>C. gl&aacute;bra</i>; <i>C. obl&iacute;qua</i>;
<i>C. barb&agrave;ta</i>; <i>C. atropurp&ugrave;rea</i>; <i>C. pulch&eacute;lla</i>; <i>C. ven&uacute;sta</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
and <i>C. speci&ograve;sa</i>; are all handsome, and flower from
May to September; corolla large, ringent; ventricose
flowers in spikes or panicles.</p>

<p><i>Chrys&aacute;nthemums.</i> There are few of this genus of
any consequence as herbaceous plants, except the
varieties of <i>C. sin&eacute;nse</i>, of which there are about fifty,
all desirable; but in small gardens, where there is a
deficiency in room, the following are select in colour
and quality: <i>Tubul&ograve;sum &aacute;lbum</i>, quilled white; <i>sup&eacute;rbum</i>,
superb white; <i>d&iacute;scolor</i>, large lilac; <i>f&uacute;lvum</i>, Spanish
brown; <i>atropurp&ugrave;reum</i>, early crimson; <i>invol&ugrave;tum</i>, curled
lilac; <i>fascicul&agrave;tum</i>, superb cluster yellow; <i>serot&igrave;num</i>,
late pale purple; <i>papyr&agrave;ceum</i>, paper white; <i>Warat&aacute;h</i>,
yellow Waratah; <i>vers&iacute;color</i>, two-coloured red; <i>stell&agrave;tum</i>,
starry purple; <i>verec&uacute;ndum</i>, early blush; and <i>mut&aacute;bile</i>,
changeable pale buff. To grow these in perfection,
they require rich light soil; and about the end of this
month the roots should be lifted, divided, and planted
into fresh soil, either by giving them a new situation,
or changing the earth they were in. Two or three
stems together are quite sufficient. The flowers, by
the above treatment, will be much larger, more double,
and finer in colour; where they are wanted to grow
low and bushy, top them in June, but not later than
the first of July. Where the soil is rich, and the plant
having only one stem, by topping it, makes a beautiful
bush. They are in flower from the first of October
until severe frost; thus beautifying our gardens at a
season when they would be destitute of one single
attraction. If the season is dry, to water them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
liquid manure will add to their vigour. They are all
natives of China, and greatly esteemed by the Chinese,
who only allow a few blooms to come out on the top
of each stem, thereby having the flowers much finer.</p>

<p><i>Cl&eacute;matis</i>, Virgin's-bower. A few species are good herbaceous
plants, of upright growth, and blue flowers, <i>C.
integrif&ograve;lia</i>; <i>C. angustif&ograve;lia</i>; and <i>C. er&eacute;cta</i>; they grow
best in light soil.</p>

<p><i>Core&oacute;psis</i>, chiefly native plants, and free-flowering;
colour principally yellow; flowers rayed. <i>C. tenuif&ograve;lia</i>,
<i>C. verticill&aacute;ta</i>, <i>C. d&iacute;scolor</i>, and <i>C. tr&iacute;pteris</i>, are the finest
of the genus, and will grow in any common garden soil.</p>

<p><i>Delph&iacute;nums.</i> There are some showy border flowers
of these, of strong growth. The leaves are much divided;
the flowers in terminale spikes; colour blue,
purple, red, white and yellow, with various shades. <i>D.
grandifl&ograve;rum</i>, with its varieties, are the best of the genus.
<i>D. interm&egrave;dium</i>, and its varieties, <i>D. el&aacute;tum</i>, Bee Larkspur,
from the ringent part of the flower being very
like a bee, and <i>D. mont&aacute;num</i>, are good varieties, and
easily cultivated. When the plants become large, they
ought to be divided, and planted in fresh soil. They
are in bloom from May to September.</p>

<p><i>Di&aacute;nthus.</i> Some of the species of this genus are the
most prominent of the Flower-garden, not only for
their beauty, but also their fragrance, which is peculiarly
grateful, especially in the well known and celebrated
pink and carnation, with the Sweet-william,
which was esteemed, in the days of old, "for its beauty
to deck up the bosoms of the beautiful, and garlands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and crowns for pleasure." The finest species are <i>D.
barb&agrave;tus</i>, and <i>D. barb&agrave;tus pl&egrave;no</i>, Sweet-william; <i>D. discolor</i>
<i>D. chin&egrave;nsis</i>; <i>D. alp&iacute;nus</i>, <i>D. sup&eacute;rbus</i>; <i>D. caryophyllus</i>,
from which have originated the Picotee and the
Carnation; <i>D. plum&agrave;rius</i>, from which originated the
Double Pink; <i>D. fr&agrave;grans</i> and <i>D. sup&eacute;rbus</i>. Several of
these, although they will stand the severest cold, have
to be protected in frames during winter, to have them
in the perfection of beauty. For the character of a
Pink and Carnation, see <i>May</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dict&aacute;mnus.</i> Two species of this genus, <i>D. fraxin&eacute;lla</i>
and <i>D. &aacute;lbus</i>, have been cultivated and esteemed upwards
of two hundred and forty years. A plant
of the first of these species, when gently rubbed, emits
an odour like that of lemon-peel; and when bruised
emits a balsamic scent, which is strongest in the pedicles
of the flowers. They have glands of a rusty
colour, that exude a viscid juice, or resin, which exhales
in vapour, and in a dark place may be seen to
take fire. Its flowers are red, those of the other white,
in loose terminale spikes; the flower has five petals,
clawed and unequal, with glandular dots; in bloom
from May to July; delights in sandy loam.</p>

<p><i>Dodec&agrave;theon.</i> This is a native genus, and commonly
called American cowslip. The generic term, a name
of the Romans, signifying twelve gods or divinities, is
applied with great absurdity to a plant, a native of a
world the Romans never saw nor had any idea of,
neither resembling, in any particular, the poetical fancy
of their writers. The most admired species is <i>D. m&egrave;dia</i>;
the flowers are in umbels, on a pedicle, from six to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
twelve inches high; the corolla is rotata reflexa, colour
light purple, bottom of petals lake and yellow; blooming
in May. The white variety is very much esteemed,
and surpasses the preceding. The ground is pure
white, the bottom of the petals the same as the other.
There is also a spotted variety found on the banks of
the Missouri. They delight in brown loam, a half
shady situation, inclining to moisture. The foliage
soon decays after flowering.</p>

<p><i>Digit&agrave;lis</i>, Fox-glove, about forty species of annuals
and herbaceous plants. A few are cultivated in the
flower borders, and are very showy. These are D.
<i>leucoph&aelig;a</i>, D. <i>ferrug&iacute;nea</i>, D. <i>ochrole&ugrave;ca</i>, large yellow; and
D. <i>purpur&aacute;scens</i>; and are good species. D. <i>purp&uacute;rea</i> and
D. <i>&aacute;lba</i>, are very conspicuous biennials; the flowers are
solitary, and in long spikes; the corolla of D. <i>purp&uacute;rea</i>
is campanulate, ventricose, and ringent; the interior is
spotted, and is considered the finest of the genus. Delights
in poor soil, with a little shade.</p>

<p><i>Eupat&oacute;riums.</i> These generally are native plants,
not worthy of notice here, except for two species. <i>E.
c&oelig;lest&iacute;num</i> has syngenesious flowers in flattened panicles,
colour fine light blue, blooming from September to
November, desirable for its beauty at that season. <i>E.
arom&agrave;ticum</i> may be cultivated for its spicy odour;
flowers white, in loose terminale panicles; blooming
from August to October. Either of them will grow in
common soil.</p>

<p><i>Genti&aacute;nas</i>, a genus of very showy plants, and flower in
great abundance. The flowers are tubular and inflated;
colour generally blue. A few species are yellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
and some white; flowers in whorls, terminale, or solitary.
They grow best in a light rich soil. <i>G. l&uacute;tea</i>, <i>G.
purp&uacute;rea</i>, <i>G. sept&eacute;mfida</i>. <i>G. aca&uacute;lis</i> is a pretty dwarf
growing species, and often used as edgings in flower
compartments; the flower dark and light blue; interior
of the corolla spotted; has a succession of flower from
April to June. We have no doubt of it succeeding in
our gardens, but not being plentiful, it has not been
perfectly tried. A few years will exhibit it in abundance.
<i>G. imbric&agrave;ta</i> and <i>G. conf&eacute;rta</i>. They are all
fine exotics, but many of them may give place to our
native species, such as <i>G. Catesb&aelig;&iacute;</i>; <i>G. ochrole&uacute;ca</i>; <i>G.
incarn&agrave;ta</i>; with several others, and <i>G. crin&agrave;ta</i>, which
is a biennial, and finely fringed; colour light blue.</p>

<p><i>G&egrave;um.</i> There are only two species that are worth
cultivation, viz. <i>G. qu&eacute;llyon</i>, once <i>G. cocc&iacute;neum</i>; and
<i>G. hybridum</i>. <i>G. urb&agrave;num</i> is sometimes cultivated for
its roots, which, when chewed, sweeten the breath.
They are all of easy culture. <i>G. qu&eacute;llyon</i> flowers from
May to October, and is a very desirable small plant for
the borders, and much esteemed in Europe.</p>

<p><i>Hemeroc&aacute;llis</i>, Day Lily; two species, <i>H. f&uacute;lva</i> and <i>H.
gram&iacute;nea</i>, flower well, and are remarkable among the
border flowers for their large yellow or copper coloured
corollas, some of them about six inches diameter;
bloom from May to July, and will grow in almost any
soil. There is a plant known in our gardens as <i>H.
c&aelig;r&ugrave;lea</i>, which is <i>F&uacute;nkia c&aelig;r&ugrave;lea</i>, and has a campanulate
corolla, with a cylindrical tube; flowers in spikes;
leaves ovate, accuminate.</p>

<p><i>Hib&iacute;scus.</i> There are several herbaceous species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
very showy and handsome, <i>H. pal&uacute;stris</i>; <i>H. r&ograve;seus</i>; <i>H.
milit&agrave;ris</i>; <i>H. speci&ograve;sus</i>; <i>H. grandifl&ograve;rus</i>; and <i>H. p&uacute;ngens</i>.
They grow best in moist situations, and where
these are not to be had, give them plenty of water,
and plant in sandy soil enriched with decayed leaves.
The flowers are about six inches in diameter, flowering
up the stem, either solitary or in small bunches.
<i>H. speci&ograve;sus</i> is the most splendid, and deserves a situation
in every garden. The roots in winter ought to
be covered by litter, tan, or saw dust; but a better method
is to lift them, and put them in the cellar, covered
with dry earth, and kept from the frost. All the above
mentioned species are improved by being protected
during winter.</p>

<p><i>Iris</i>, Flower-de-luce, has many fine species of various
shades and colours, <i>I. subifl&ograve;ra</i>, <i>I. nepal&eacute;nsis</i>, <i>I. Pall&agrave;sii</i>,
<i>I. p&aacute;llida</i>, <i>I. crist&agrave;ta</i>, <i>I. aren&agrave;ria</i>, <i>I. furc&agrave;ta</i>, <i>I. germ&aacute;nica</i>,
<i>I. florent&igrave;na</i>, <i>I. v&eacute;rna</i>, and <i>I. susi&agrave;na</i>. The last is the
finest of the herbaceous species; the flowers are striped,
blue, brown, and spotted; but we are not certain if it
will stand the severity of our winters. The roots of <i>I.
florent&igrave;na</i> is the orrice root of the druggists. They are
all of easy culture in any loamy soil inclining to moisture.
The bulbous species will be treated of in <i>September</i>
or <i>October</i>. Corolla six-petaled, three erect,
and three reclined alternately; proceeding from spathes
or sheaths with flowers in succession.</p>

<p><i>L&igrave;atris</i> is a genus of native plants, containing several
fine species, <i>L. squarr&ograve;sa</i>, large purple heads of
beautiful flowers; <i>L. &eacute;legans</i>; <i>L. panicul&agrave;ta</i>. <i>L. macr&oacute;stachya</i>,
now <i>L. spic&agrave;ta</i>, is a fine large growing species.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
They have syngenesious purple flowers in long close
spikes, differing from other spiked flowering genera by
blooming first at the extremity. They grow best in
strong heavy soil.</p>

<p><i>Lychnis.</i> Three species are very desirable in the
flower borders. <i>L. chalced&oacute;nica</i> has bright scarlet
crowned flowers; the double scarlet variety is splendid.
There is also a double white variety, <i>L. f&uacute;lgens</i> and <i>L.
fl&oacute;s-j&ograve;vis</i>. They ought to be frequently lifted, and
planted afresh, or they will dwindle to nothing. The
best time is when they begin to grow. There is a
plant known in our collections as <i>Lychnis fl&oacute;s-cuc&ugrave;la</i>,
which is now <i>Agrost&eacute;ma fl&oacute;s-cuc&ugrave;la</i>; it is a fine and
showy border plant with double red flowers. They delight
in a light sandy rich soil.</p>

<p><i>Lythrums.</i> A few species flower well, and have
small pink blossoms in great profusion, <i>L. al&agrave;tum</i>, <i>L.
virg&agrave;tum</i>, <i>L. diff&ugrave;sum</i>, and <i>L. lanceol&agrave;tum</i>. They will
grow in any common garden soil if not too much
shaded; and flower from June to September.</p>

<p><i>Mim&ugrave;lus</i>, Monkey-flower. A few species may be
cultivated. They will grow in any soil or situation.
<i>M. l&ugrave;teus</i> and <i>M. rivul&agrave;ris</i> are the best. <i>M. mosch&agrave;tus</i>
has a very strong musk scent, to many agreeable. We
think it will prove hardy. The two former have large
gaping flowers, of a gold yellow, and beautifully spotted
with purple in the interior.</p>

<p><i>Mon&aacute;rdas</i>, a fine native genus and showy. The foliage
of several of the species is aromatic, and resembles
mint. <i>M. d&iacute;dyma</i> has long scarlet ringent flowers,
in headed whorls; <i>M. kalmiana</i>, flowers very long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and a beautiful crimson, with fragrant leaves. <i>M. Russelliana</i>
has red and white flowers; curious and handsome.
<i>M. punctata</i> has yellow and red flowers; they
grow in any common soil.</p>

<p><i>Math&iacute;ola</i>, is the generic of the Stock-gilly. None of
them will survive severe winters; yet many of them
are indispensable in the Flower-garden. <i>M. simplicic&aacute;ulis</i>,
Brompton-stock, and its varieties; with <i>M. inc&agrave;na</i>,
Queen-stock, and its varieties, require the protection
of a good frame in winter, and about the end of
this month, or beginning of next, plant them in good
light rich soil to flower, which they will do all summer,
if attended to with frequent supplies of water. <i>M. &aacute;nnua</i>
has about sixteen varieties, valuable for flowering
the first year from seed, and are all annuals. They
ought to be sown on a gentle hot-bed about the first of
this month, and carefully pricked out so as they may
be ready to transplant about the end of April or the
first of May. Plant them in light rich soil, and they
will flower profusely through the season; if it is very
dry, they must be watered to keep them growing. The
scarlet, white, and purple varieties are the finest; but
there are many intermediate sorts all handsome. <i>M.
gl&agrave;bra</i> is the Wall-flower leaved stock, and requires the
same treatment as the two former. There are about
eight varieties of this, all various in colour. In planting
any of these into the open ground, choose cloudy
weather, except they have been in pots; in such case,
plant at any time in beds, keeping each kind separate.</p>

<p><i>&#338;noth&egrave;ras.</i> The most of them are indigenous, and
in Europe they afford a continual ornament to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Flower-garden from April to November, but in our
gardens they are entirely neglected. By rejecting
these and many others, our Flower-gardens are deprived
both of much beauty and interest they might
easily possess. These plants delight in light rich soil.
<i>&#338;. odor&agrave;ta</i>, sweet scented; <i>&#338;. macroc&aacute;rpa</i>; <i>&#338;. m&egrave;dia</i>;
<i>&#338;. latifl&ograve;ra</i>; <i>&#338;. Fraz&egrave;ri</i>; <i>&#338;. speci&ograve;sa</i>; and <i>&#338;. p&aacute;llida</i>;
are all fine native herbaceous plants, mostly with large
yellow four-petaled corollas; in bloom from April to
September. There are several of them beautiful annual
and biennial plants. For the finest, see list.</p>

<p><i>Phl&oacute;x</i>, another American genus, and one of the
most handsome in cultivation. It consists of elegant
border flowers, valuable for flowering early, and more
so for blossoming late in autumn. While the majority
of plants blooming late in the season are generally
syngenesious, with yellow flowers, these delight
us with their lively colours of purple, red, and white.
A collection of them properly attended to, would of
themselves constitute a beautiful flower garden. It
will be difficult to state which are the finest, but the
following are select varieties: P. <i>panicul&agrave;ta</i>; P. <i>acumin&agrave;ta</i>;
P. <i>interm&egrave;dia</i>; P. <i>odor&agrave;ta</i>; P. <i>pyramid&agrave;lis</i>; with
<i>pyramid&agrave;lis &aacute;lba</i>, which is splendid; P. <i>suav&egrave;olens</i>; P.
<i>refl&eacute;xa</i>; P. <i>stolon&iacute;fera</i>; P. <i>pil&ograve;sa</i>; P. <i>divaric&agrave;ta</i>; P. <i>niv&agrave;lis</i>;
and P. <i>subul&agrave;ta</i>. In the spring of 1831, an eminent
British collector<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> exclaimed, on seeing a patch
of P. <i>subul&agrave;ta</i> in one of the pine barrens of New Jersey,
"The beauty of that alone is worth coming to
America to see, it is so splendid." Most of the spe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>cies
delight in a rich light sandy loam. When the
plants become large, they ought to be divided, and
planted in fresh ground.</p>

<p><i>Pr&iacute;mulas</i>, Primrose. To this genus belong the celebrated
<i>Cowslip</i>, <i>Oxlip</i>, <i>Primrose</i>, and the esteemed
<i>Aur&iacute;cula</i>. The double varieties of Primrose have originated
from <i>P. vulg&agrave;ris</i>. These are such as carry
their flowers on separate pedicles, rising from the root
on a small stem. The double varieties are desirable
for their beauty, but require the protection of a frame
during winter. They are in colour red, white, yellow,
lilac, purple, and crimson. P. <i>el&agrave;tior</i> is the Oxlip, from
which all the <i>Poly&aacute;nthuses</i> have been grown. They are
in variety innumerable, and are those whose flowers
are in umbels, on a scape or flower-stalk, rising from
three to nine inches. The rules for judging of their
merits are wholly artificial, agreed on from time to
time by Florists. The one that is the leading beauty
this year would in a few years be far in the rear. The
principal character is that the corolla is not notched
or fringed; the colours pure and distinct, not running
into one another; the tube small; the eye round, and a
little prominent. Being surrounded with white, and
the ground purple, is a fine character. P. <i>aur&iacute;cula</i>.
From this the highly esteemed varieties have originated.
The cultivated <i>aur&iacute;cula</i> has many admirers, both
for its exquisite beauty and fragrance. For the criterion
of a fine flower see <i>May</i>. There are several
other species worthy of a situation, such as P. <i>cortuso&iacute;des</i>,
P. <i>dentifl&ograve;ra</i>, P. <i>suav&egrave;olens</i>, P. <i>dec&ograve;ra</i>, with P. <i>sc&oacute;tica</i>
and P. <i>farin&ograve;sa</i>, both small neat species. A shady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
situation agrees best with them; and they require
loamy soil, free from any kind of manure, except it be
fully decomposed. The leaves of P. <i>v&egrave;ris</i> are recommended
for feeding silk worms.</p>

<p><i>Potent&iacute;llas.</i> We mention this genus here as affording
several free flowering dwarf plants; not as being
certain that any of the most desired species will withstand
our winters, being natives of Nepaul; but, from
the character of the plant, we think that they are
adapted to bear severe cold. They are similar to the
strawberry in habit and appearance. P. <i>nepal&eacute;nsis</i>, or
<i>form&ograve;sa</i>, has rose-coloured flowers; P. <i>atropurp&ugrave;rea</i>;
P. <i>Russelli&agrave;na</i>, scarlet; P. <i>Hopwoodi&agrave;na</i>, rose and scarlet;
and P. <i>spl&eacute;ndens</i>, yellow, with superb leaves. These
are the finest of the genus, and flower from May to
September. It will be well to protect them in a frame
with the Carnations; they delight in light soil.</p>

<p><i>Sapon&agrave;ria officin&agrave;lis</i>, and <i>S. O. pl&egrave;na</i>, are fine free-flowering
dwarf plants; the colour is pink in both double
and single varieties. The roots run under ground,
and care should be taken to keep them within bounds:
they flower from June till October. <i>S. c&aelig;spit&ograve;sa</i> is a neat
growing species of a rose colour. They will grow in
any soil.</p>

<p><i>Sil&egrave;ne.</i> Several of this genus are popular annuals,
but the herbaceous species are very indifferent. <i>S.
visc&oacute;sa</i> and S. <i>visc&oacute;sa fl&ograve;re pl&egrave;na</i>, are frequently cultivated
for their beauty; they will grow well if not too much
shaded.</p>

<p><i>Sax&iacute;fraga</i>, above one hundred species. Many of
them are beautiful plants for rock-work. They are re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>gardless
of cold, but will not generally withstand much
moisture. A few of them are highly deserving a situation
in any garden. <i>S. hirs&ugrave;tum</i>, and <i>S. crassif&ograve;lia</i>, are
used in some countries for tanning. <i>S. granul&agrave;ta multipl&eacute;x</i>
has fine double-white flowers, and is desirable.
<i>S. umbr&ograve;sa</i>, London-pride, makes a beautiful edging
for a flower border; the flowers are small, but on close
examination its colours are unrivalled. It is vulgarly
called, "none so pretty." <i>S. sarment&ograve;sa</i> is kept in the
Green-house, but is perfectly hardy, and makes a fine
plant in a shaded situation. We have no doubt but it
would make a good fancy edging. <i>S. pulch&eacute;lla</i>, straw
coloured, and <i>S. pyramid&agrave;lis</i>; these are all easily cultivated;
and flower in spikes from May to July.</p>

<p><i>Spir&aelig;as.</i> A few species are showy plants, and continue
flowering from May to September. <i>S. ulm&agrave;ria
m&uacute;ltiplex</i>, Meadow-sweet, has sweet scented white
flowers, in long dense spikes. <i>S. Filip&eacute;ndula m&uacute;ltiplex</i>,
Drop-wort, double white. <i>S. lob&agrave;ta</i> is a native, and
has fine rose coloured flowers, in June and July; these
are the finest of the herbaceous species, and will grow
in any common garden soil.</p>

<p><i>St&aacute;tice</i>, Thrift. A genus containing many fine herbaceous
plants, only a few of them are common in collections.
The finest of them are scarce, and said to be
"bad to cultivate." <i>S. vulg&agrave;ris</i>, once <i>Arm&egrave;ria vulg&agrave;ris</i>,
is the most valuable plant for an edging, next to box,
that the Flower-garden is possessed of, and does extremely
well in our climate, flowering in great profusion
from May to July. When done flowering, the stems
should be cut off. The foliage is an agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
evergreen; the plant increases rapidly, and in a few
years may be planted to a great extent. <i>S. speci&ograve;sa</i> has
red flowers, crowded in spreading panicles. <i>S. tat&agrave;rica</i>
has also very showy flowers, and is now given to the
genus <i>Tax&agrave;nthema</i>. <i>S. latif&ograve;lia</i> and <i>S. marit&igrave;ma</i> are the
finest. <i>T. latif&ograve;lia</i> and <i>T. consp&iacute;cua</i> deserve attention.
They should be lifted every alternate year, and sunk
deeper into the soil, because they incline to grow out,
and are sometimes during summer killed by the drought.
Hence they are said to be "bad to cultivate."</p>

<p><i>Tr&oacute;llius europ&aelig;us</i>, and <i>T. asi&agrave;ticus</i>, are fine border
plants, with large yellow semi-double flowers; the petals
are much cupped, which causes the flowers to have a
globular appearance. They are easily grown in any
loamy soil, and flower from May to July. Few flowers
have the curious globular character which these have.</p>

<p><i>Ver&oacute;nica</i>, Speed-well. This genus consists of about
one hundred and twenty species of herbaceous plants,
besides several varieties. The flowers are in long
close spikes, either white, flesh coloured, or blue; they
are generally of the latter colour. Above sixty species
are equally fine, and being generally of the same character,
the Catalogue at the end of this work will contain
the best selection that we can make. Very few
of them are in the collections of the country, although
they are very showy, and flower from June to August.
They will grow in any soil, but will not flourish where
they are much shaded. <i>V. officin&agrave;lis</i> has been used in
Germany and Sweden as a substitute for tea. Some
prefer <i>V. cham&aelig;drys</i> for the same purpose.</p>

<p><i>Valer&igrave;anas.</i> Several species are showy border plants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
with small flowers in large close flattened panicles. <i>V.
dio&iacute;ca</i> is remarkable for having the stamens and pistils
in separate flowers, situated on different plants; the
flowers are of a blush colour, and the roots when
planted must be protected from the cats, for they are
delighted with them, and scrape them up. <i>V. ph&ugrave;</i>, a
large growing species with white flowers; and <i>V. r&ugrave;bra</i>,
with its varieties, are the finest of the genus. They
are now given to <i>Centr&agrave;nthus</i>. They are all of easy
culture in common garden earth, but preferring moist
shady situations. In flower from May to September.</p>

<p><i>V&igrave;ola</i>, a genus consisting of upwards of eighty species,
of low pretty plants, of great diversity of colour
and foliage. Many of them are natives, and well worth
a situation in our gardens. They mostly delight in
sandy loam, and a little shade. A few of the species
grow in moist situations. The most esteemed varieties
for fragrance are, <i>V. odor&agrave;ta purp&uacute;rea pl&egrave;na</i>, double
purple, with <i>V. odor&agrave;ta &agrave;lba pl&egrave;na</i>, double white. They
flower very early, and make good edgings where they
are kept in order; flowering profusely from April to
June, and flowering again in autumn.</p>

<p><i>Y&uacute;cca</i>, Adam's-needle. This is a very showy and ornamental
genus; their character forming a picturesque
contrast in the Flower-garden; foliage long, narrow,
lanceolate, and stiff; with white companulate flowers,
about two inches in diameter, in conical spikes from
two to four feet long, arising from the centre of the
plant, containing frequently from two to four hundred
florets. They are principally native plants. <i>Y. str&iacute;cta</i>
is the freest flowerer. <i>Y. sup&eacute;rba</i>; <i>Y. aloif&ograve;lia</i>; <i>Y.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
<i>angustif&ograve;lia</i>, <i>Y. acumin&agrave;ta</i>, <i>Y. serrul&agrave;ta</i>, and <i>Y. filament&ograve;sa</i>,
are all fine species, and will grow in any common soil.
When in flower, if protected from the sun by an awning,
they will be of considerable duration. There are
variegated varieties of <i>Str&iacute;cta</i>, <i>Aloif&ograve;lia</i>, and <i>Serrul&agrave;ta</i>,
which look very handsome in foliage, but are at
present very rare, and it will be a number of years before
they are plentiful. There ought at least to be one
specimen of some of the free-flowering species in every
garden.</p>

<p>Having given the names and characters of a few
herbaceous plants, all or most of them easily obtained,
many of them extremely handsome, and such as
agree best with transplanting at this season of the
year; for several others, such as <i>P&aelig;&ograve;nias</i>, or any other
strong fibrous or bulbous sorts, see <i>September</i> and <i>October</i>.
Where they are in pots, they can be planted at
any time, the weather permitting, provided the ball of
earth is not broken. But where they are only to be
removed, the best time is just as vegetation commences.
That herbaceous plants may look to the best advantage,
and flower well, they must not be allowed to get
into large stools; but as soon as they are above one
foot in diameter, they should be divided.</p>

<p>Very frequently those who perform this operation,
take the spade, and cut a piece off all round, which to a
degree improves the look of the plant; but this is only
half justice. It should be lifted entirely, fresh soil
given, or removed a few feet, and planted a little deeper
than it was before, as the plant tends apparently to
grow out of the soil when allowed to stand long. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the weather becomes dry shortly after transplanting,
give them a few waterings, until they have taken fresh
roots, which will be within two weeks. Colour should
be diversified through the garden as much as practicable,
and the highest growing sorts planted farthest from
the walk, so as all may appear in view. At all times
avoid crowding the plants together.</p>


<h4>BULBOUS ROOTS.</h4>

<p>About the middle of this month, let the covering of
tan, saw-dust, or decayed leaves, be cleared from the
beds of such as were directed to be covered in November;
afterwards carefully stirring the surface among
them with a kind of wooden spatula, or wedge, breaking
the surface fine; then dress all the alleys smooth
and neat with the hoe and rake, clearing away every
particle of litter. When the leaves of Tulips are expanding,
they frequently become entangled so much,
that the force of growth breaks the foliage: if there are
any appearance of this at any time, they should be set
right with the hand. In early seasons these roots will
be far advanced, and perhaps one night of frost unexpectedly
might materially injure them. When there is
any suspicion of cold weather, hoops should be spanned
across the beds, so that the necessary mats or canvass
could in a few minutes be placed over them, to ward
off danger. Protect the finest sorts from heavy drenching
rains, and give them small neat rods for support,
as they grow up. If the rods and tyings are painted
green, the effect will be improved. These directions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
equally apply to <i>Narcissus</i>, <i>Jonquils</i>, <i>Iris</i>, and all Holland
bulbs.</p>


<h4>CARNATIONS, PINKS, PRIMROSES, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>Which have been protected by frames through the
winter, must have at all favourable opportunities
plenty of air admitted to them by lifting the sashes,
and in fine mild days and nights, the sashes may be
taken entirely off. Divest them of all decayed leaves,
and stir up the earth on the surface of the pots;
those that are intended to be planted in the garden
may be set to one side, while those that are to be kept
in pots must be more strictly attended to. Of these the
Pinks and Carnations should be repotted about the first
of the month. Those that have been kept in four inch
pots, should be put into pots of seven inches, and those
that are in five inch pots may be put into eight inch.
Give a gentle watering after repotting. Pinks do not
require the pots so large, but the same treatment in
every other respect. Where the extremity of the leaves
are decayed, cut them off, with any other decayed
leaves: the pots must be well drained with shivers or
fine gravel. Give them plenty of air, otherwise they
will be weak in growth.</p>

<p><i>Primroses</i> require only a little fresh earth on the top
of the pots. <i>Daisies</i> may be planted out in shady
situations; the sun destroys them during summer if
exposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>


<h4>AURICULAS.</h4>

<p>These beautiful and highly interesting plants are, to
a great degree, neglected in our collections. It cannot
be from want of beauty or fragrance that they have
not attracted our attention, for they are exquisite in
both. We are rather inclined to think that those who
have them do not give them the treatment they require
yearly to perfect their bloom. They should now have
the surface earth taken off about half an inch down,
and fresh soil added, which will cause them to put out
fresh fibres about the upper part of the roots, and
greatly increase their growth. The frame in which
they are placed should now face the east, as the sun
will be too strong for them; and about the end of the
month turn it to the north. The glass of the frame
may be white-washed, which will partially shade
them from the sun, that being their delight. Give
them water sparingly until they begin to grow, and
never water them over the foliage previous to flowering,
as water injures that fine mealy-like substance
found on many of the sorts, and which so greatly
improves their beauty. Defend them, therefore,
from rain and high winds. To have them flower
strongly, only one flower stem should be allowed to
grow. The first one that shows is generally the best.
At all events leave the strongest, and cut off all the
others, or only nip off the flower pips, which answers
the same end. Never keep the sash off during night,
lest it should rain before morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>


<h4>RANUNCULUS AND ANEMONE.</h4>

<p>The frames must have plenty of air, and give frequent
sprinklings of water. The sashes or boards
should be taken entirely off every mild day, and in fine
nights leave them exposed to the dew; stir up the
earth amongst them, breaking it fine, making all neat.
They require liberal supplies of water after they begin
to grow.</p>


<h4>ROSES.</h4>

<p>This is the most favourable month for planting all
kinds of garden roses, which must be done as soon as
the weather opens, and the ground in a proper state.
The earlier in the month they flower the more perfect
they will be. Never delay planting when there is an
opportunity; for if delayed until the leaves are expanding,
the bloom will be much weakened, and the probability
is there will be no flowers, and the plants meet
with a premature death. It has been said, "there is a
particular advantage in planting some every ten days,
even to the middle of May; for the flowering of them
may be retarded in this way, and the bloom of these
delightful shrubs continue for a much longer period."
One moment's reflection will convince us, that nature,
while in her own element, will not be retarded, suppose
there was no danger of instantaneous death to
the plants. The artificial means that might be judiciously
adopted, with which we are acquainted, to keep
back the blooming of hardy plants, is to lift them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
soon in spring as is practicable, put them in boxes of
earth, and then place them in the driest part of an icehouse
until the desired time of planting, which may be
delayed as long as the required time of flowering.
This will be found a true method of retarding the
flowering of roses especially, and not going counter to
the rules and principles of nature. There are many
beautiful varieties of the garden rose in cultivation,
the names of the finest of which we will give in the
Catalogue, but perhaps it may be proper to mention
here a few of the most particular sorts. The finest
unquestionably when in bloom, is the <i>Moss</i> and its varieties,
but the flowering is of so limited duration, that it
is in a great degree surpassed by others. There is
said to be a striped variety of the <i>Moss Rose</i>, but we
do not credit it. The <i>Blush Moss</i>, <i>Clinton White Moss</i>,
and <i>Mottled Moss</i>, at present certainly are the most superb
of that kind. <i>Lee's Crimson Perpetual</i> is a magnificent
rose, and flowers in profusion from June to October.
This is considered, and justly too, the finest of all
the garden roses; its fragrance is exquisite, and the
plant highly valued. There is a striped <i>Unique Rose</i>,
and a <i>Rosa tricolor</i>, which are much thought of. We
have mentioned these as the finest we have seen, but
amongst two thousand cultivated varieties of the garden
rose, there must be many of equal beauty. Of
<i>R&oacute;sa spinos&iacute;ssima</i> there are above three hundred varieties;
<i>R. g&agrave;llica</i>; two hundred; <i>R. centif&ograve;lia</i>, one hundred
and fifty; <i>R. damasc&egrave;ne</i>, above one hundred; <i>R. &aacute;lba</i>,
fifty; <i>R. rubigin&oacute;sa</i>, thirty; and of various sorts above
eleven hundred. In several individual collections of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Europe, there are cultivated above fifteen hundred
species, sub-species, and varieties.</p>

<p>When planted, they are too frequently crowded indiscriminately
amongst other shrubs, which prevents
them having the effect they would have if planted singly
or grouped. They vary in size in different sorts from
one to ten feet. When planted in the latter method, they
should be assimilated in size of leaves and manner of
growth, with the greatest variation of flower; or if
planted in many small patches, giving each a distinct
colour, which has a picturesque effect. An other desirable
and fanciful method, is to plant them in figures,
giving them edgings of wire, willow, or any other substitute,
in imitation of basket work, which is called
"baskets of roses;" the ground enclosed in the basket
margin to be made convex, which will present a greater
surface to the eye; the strong shoots to be layered, or
kept down by pegs into the ground, having the
points of the shoots only to appear above the
soil, which should be covered with moss. With this
treatment, in a few years the whole surface of the basket
will be covered with rose buds and leaves, of one
or various sorts. If two or three of the larger growing
sorts are taken, such as <i>Moss</i> or <i>Provins</i>, they may be
trained so as to cover a surface of several square yards.
One of these covered with <i>Lee's Crimson Perpetual
Rose</i>, would be one of the greatest ornaments of the
Flower-garden.</p>

<p>A modern invention in the cultivation of the rose is,
to grow them in shape of trees, by budding on strong
growing kinds at different heights from the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
according to taste, and the purposes intended. They
will form in a few years handsome round heads, which
will flower more freely than by layers, or trained on
their own stalk. They are particularly desirable
amongst low shrubs. When planted, they should be
well supported by strong rods, to prevent the wind
from destroying them. If any of the roots have been
bruised in lifting, cut off the bruised part with the
knife, and likewise shorten the young shoots; breaking
the earth well about their roots when planting. This
has been an esteemed shrub among all civilized nations.
The flowers are double, semi-double, and
single; the colours are pink, red, purple, white, yellow,
and striped, with almost every shade and mixture; the
odour universally grateful. This plant is cultivated in
every garden, from the humblest cottager to the
loftiest prince, and by commercial gardeners in Europe
extensively, for distilling rose water, and making
the essential oil of roses. They delight in a rich
loamy soil, and require plenty of moisture while in a
growing state. Those sorts which throw up numerous
suckers should be lifted every three or four years, reduced,
and then transplanted. When thus removing
them, avoid as much as possible exposing their roots;
and when newly planted, mulching is of considerable
advantage; that is, putting half rotten stable-manure
on the surface of the ground round their roots, which
prevents evaporation, and keeps up a constant moisture.
If this was done in general to our roses in dry
seasons, it would greatly improve their flowering.
For China roses see next month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>


<h4>CLIMBING ROSES.</h4>

<p>This is the best time to prune ever-blooming climbing
roses, such as <i>Champney</i>, <i>Scarlet Cluster</i>, <i>Duchesse de
Dino</i>, <i>Notsette</i>, <i>Burgenville</i>, &amp;c. Many of these, when
allowed to grow year after year without pruning, become
unsightly; they never bear flowers on the old
wood, that is, wood of three or four years. Having a
tendency to throw out young shoots from the bottom
of the stem, the old wood should be cut out, thus encouraging
the young wood, which the second year
bears the most and finest flowers. In severe winters,
the extremities of the shoots are frequently killed, and
we have often seen all the wood black or brown, and
apparently dead. When that is the case it is best to
leave it until they begin to grow, which will show what
is dead or alive, when they can be pruned to better advantage.</p>


<h4>DECIDUOUS ORNAMENTAL FLOWERING SHRUBS.</h4>

<p>The earlier the planting of these shrubs is attended to
in this month, the more will their growth and flowering
be promoted, having all finished before the buds begin to
expand. (For kinds recommended see List, end of the
volume.) They should never be planted too thick, but
leave space for them to grow as they respectively require,
and according as they are designed for open or
close shrubberies, clumps, or thickets. Have all in
readiness, that it may be done with as much expedition
as possible, to prevent their roots from being dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
by the sun and wind in time of planting. Make the
holes intended for their reception round, capacious,
and deep enough to hold their roots, without confining
them in the least, and loosen the bottom well, putting
new and fresh soil under their roots, breaking
and pulverizing it during the operation, and frequently
shaking the plant as you progress in filling up.
When done, make all firm with the foot, leaving
a circular cavity to hold the water they will require
during dry weather. Give rods, and tie with
bands all that need that support before they are left,
lest they should be neglected. Cut off any of the
bruised roots or irregular growths of the branches.</p>


<h4>GRASS PLATS AND WALKS.</h4>

<p>Rake and sweep off from these all litter and worm
cast earth, and give an occasional rolling to settle the
ground, and render the surface smooth, where the
scythe is to be used. The grass will likewise grow
better by rolling it where the frost has partially
thrown it out, and add greatly to the beauty of the
whole. Cut the edgings with an edging iron or spade,
so that the whole will have a finished appearance. If
any new turf is required to be laid down, this is a very
good time to do it, before vegetation is strong; as the
turf that is now laid will have taken root before the
dry season commences. Where a great extent is to
be done, sowing might be adopted; but it will not have
the effect of turf under three years, and during that
time must be carefully cut, after the first season, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
three weeks, while growing, nor must it be walked
upon. White clover and true perennial rye-grass are
the seeds most proper for sowing. The ground must
in the first place be all equally made up, and levelled
with the spade and rake; not "cart loads of soil laid
down and leveled," which would finally become very
uneven, and would need to be lifted and relaid next
year. The best turf is that of a close growing pasture
or common, free from all kinds of weeds or strong roots,
and the grass short. To cut it expeditiously, be provided
with a turfing-iron; but if that cannot be conveniently
had, a spade may do very well. Strain a line
tight, cutting the turf lengthways, at equal distances, from
twelve to eighteen inches. Next draw the line across,
cutting from one and a half to two feet; then cut them
up with the spade, about one and a half inch thick. In
laying, join them close and alternately; when done, beat
them firm with a level wooden beater, and roll with a
heavy roller.</p>

<p>Grass walks, in the last century, were very popular;
but time having put them to the test, they are found
unfit for walking upon or using in any manner,
almost for one half of the year; therefore not answering
the purposes intended. They require great attention
to keep them in order; and if not always neat and
clean, they are a disagreeable object in a garden; but
when they are well dressed, their effect is very enlivening.
Where they are desired, prepare the ground as
above directed; making the walk a little higher than
the adjoining borders, to prevent the earth from being
washed on it by the rain. Allowing the walks to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
six feet wide, make the centre five inches higher than the
sides, or about seven-eighths of an inch to the foot whatever
the breadth may be, which will form a gentle declivity
to throw off the rain. When laid, beat and roll it
well; cutting the edge neat and even. Water frequently
if the weather sets in dry. To keep grass walks or
plats in order, they should be mown once every three
or four weeks from May to September, and the grass
each time swept clean off. When the grass is allowed
to get long before being cut, the roots become tender;
and die when exposed to the sun; at last the grass is
all in spots, and in another year requires to be relaid.</p>


<h4>GRAVEL WALKS.</h4>

<p>A practice once existed of turning these into heaps
or ridges during winter to destroy weeds, &amp;c. But this
has almost been given up as unnecessary, unsightly,
inconvenient, and not doing any material service.</p>

<p>Where the surface of these has become foul, irregular,
or mossy, they had better be turned over four or
five inches deep where the gravel will admit of it; but
if not, hoe and rake them perfectly clean, give a new
coat of gravel, and pick up any stones that you think
too large; then give them a good rolling, applying it
frequently after showers of rain. When they are well
attended to just now, they will look well all the season;
but if neglected, they take more labour, and are never
in such good condition.</p>

<p>Fancy edgings of <i>Thyme</i>, <i>Thrift</i>, <i>Gentiana</i>, <i>Lavender</i>,
and <i>Violets</i>&mdash;(<i>Daisies</i> may be used if the situation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
shaded.) The whole of these may be planted by the
line with the dibber except <i>Thyme</i>, which lay as directed
for <i>Box</i>. See this month, under that head. Any
time in this or beginning of next month will answer to
make edgings of these; and if dry weather occurs before
they begin to grow after planting, they must have
frequent waterings until they have taken fresh root.
Thyme requires to be dressed twice during the season
to keep it in order.</p>


<h4>OF GRAFTING.</h4>

<p>There are four methods of grafting. The one we
will describe is <i>whip</i> or <i>tongue grafting</i>, which is the
preferable and most expeditious plan with all deciduous
shrubs or trees. The stock upon which it is performed
must be slender, from two-thirds of an inch to any diameter
suitable to the thickness of the graft. Having
headed the stock at a clear smooth part, slope it on
one side with a sharp knife at a very acute angle, make
a slit on the lower side of the slope about an inch downwards,
to receive the tongue or wedge of the graft or
scion. Secondly, having the prepared scions cut into
lengths of 3, 4, or 5 eyes, take one which matches the
stock in size, and slope the bottom of it so as to fit the
stock, that the rinds of both may correspond exactly,
especially on one side and at bottom; make also a slit
upward in the graft, like that in the slope of the stock,
so as the one may be inserted in the other as evenly
and completely as possible. Let the graft be carefully
held in its due position, while a bandage is applied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Take strands of Russian mat, and bind them in a neat
manner several times round the stock and graft. Lastly,
cover the joint with well worked clay, coat from half
an inch below the bottom of the graft to an inch above
the top of the stock, and to the thickness of half an
inch all round, finish it in an oblong globular form,
taking care to work it close, that no air may penetrate.
If the clay is covered with moss, it will partially prevent
it from cracking.</p>

<p>The grafts will have taken when they begin to grow
freely; then the clay may be taken off, and the bandage
loosened, and put on again, but not so tight; give the
grafts a stake for support, tying them thereto to prevent
accidents from the wind. Allow no shoots to
arise from the stock.</p>

<p>Any of the rare deciduous trees may, by the above
method, be grafted on one of its own family, that is
more common, and in that respect is the finest species
of propagation that is resorted to.</p>

<h2><a name="Rooms" id="Rooms"><span class="antiqua">Rooms.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>MARCH.</i></h3>


<p>If the plants in these situations have been properly
attended to by admitting air at all favourable times, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
when the apartment was below 36&deg; a little fire heat applied
to counteract the cold, keeping the heat above
that degree; your attention will be rewarded by the
healthy appearance of your plants. The weather by
this time has generally become milder, so that air may
be more freely admitted, especially from ten to three
o'clock. Where the leaves are grown to one side,
turn the plant with the dark side to the light. They
will require a more liberal supply of water, but always
avoid keeping them wet. Pick off all decayed leaves,
and tie up any straggling shoots; stir up the earth on
the top of the pots, breaking it fine where it is hardened
by the frequent waterings. This will allow the fresh
air to act upon the roots, which is one of the principal
assistants in vegetation. For those that require shifting
or repotting, see <i>Green-house</i>, <i>March</i>; the plants
enumerated there equally apply here, if they are in the
collection, with this difference, that well kept rooms
are about two weeks earlier than the Green-house.
After the end of this month, where there is a convenience,
plants will do better in windows that look to the
east, in which the direct rays of a hot sun are prevented
from falling upon them, and the morning sun is more
congenial for plants in this country than the afternoon
sun. Where there is any dust on the leaves of any of
them, take a sponge and water, and make the whole
clean, likewise divest them of all insects. The green-fly
is perhaps on the roses; if there are no conveniences
for fumigating, wash them off as previously directed.
Where there are only a few plants, these pests could
be very easily kept off by examining the plants every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
day. For the scaly insect, see <i><a href="#Page_12">January</a></i>. If they have not
been cleared off, get it done directly; for by the heat
of the weather they will increase tenfold.</p>


<h4>FLOWERING PLANTS.</h4>

<p><i>Hyacinths</i>, <i>Tulips</i>, <i>Narcissus</i>, <i>Jonquils</i>, and <i>Crocus</i>,
will be generally in flower. The former requires plenty
of water, and the saucers under the pots should be
constantly full until they are done blooming. The
others need only be liberally supplied at the surface of
the pot. Give them neat green-painted rods to support
their flower stems, and keep them all near the
light. The spring flowering <i>Oxalis</i> will not open except
it is exposed to the full rays of the sun. The <i>Lachen&agrave;lia</i>
is greatly improved in colour with exposure to
the sun, though when in flower its beauties are preserved
by keeping it a little in the shade.</p>

<p><i>Pr&iacute;mulas</i>, or Primrose, both Chinese and European,
delight in an airy exposure; but the sun destroys the
beauty of their flowers by making the colours fade.</p>

<p><i>Cam&eacute;llias.</i> Many of them will be in perfection. See
Green-house this month for a description of the finest
varieties. Do not let the sun shine upon the blooms.
Those that are done flowering, will, in small pots, require
to be repotted. The <i>C&aacute;lla</i> or Æthopian water-lily,
when in flower, ought to stand in saucers with water.</p>

<p>The Hyacinths that are in glasses must be regularly
supplied with water. The roots will be very much reduced
by this method; therefore, when the bloom is
over, if possible plant them in the garden, or bury them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
in pots of earth, to ripen and strengthen the bulbs.
They will take two years with good encouragement,
before they can satisfactorily be again flowered in
glasses, and properly they ought not be allowed to
bloom next year. Those that are done flowering in
pots, can be set aside, and the usual waterings gradually
withdrawn. Treat all other Dutch bulbs in a similar
manner.</p>

<h2><a name="Hot-House3" id="Hot-House3"><span class="antiqua">Hot-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>APRIL.</i></h3>


<p>Where the Hot-house has been properly conducted,
the plants generally will have a vigorous and healthful
aspect. An error frequently arises in the conducting of
these departments, by inexperienced operators being
ambitious of outstripping their competitors. They keep
the house in a very high temperature, and admit little
or no air. Where such mode has been pursued, the
plants will have got over their first growth, and the
foliage look yellow and decaying, thus throwing the
plants into a state of inactivity, when nature herself
commences her most active movements. The temperature
should not be under 60&deg; nor much above 75&deg;,
without admitting a little air by the top lights. It will
not do yet to give air by the front sashes, the wind
being cool, and a current in the house would be hurtful.
The sun is not so powerful but the heat can be
kept down by the air given from above. In very cold
cutting winds, though the effects of sun heat be great,
admitting of much air may be injurious. Whatever
error may arise, let it be on the side of caution. However,
when high winds prevail, there is little danger of
the house becoming overheated by the effect of the
sun. Hot-house or tropical plants will not be hurt with
110&deg;, if they are not touching the glass. And if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
plants are near the glass generally, the glass should
have a coat of very thin white-wash (not lime), where
the glass is thin and light in colour; but if it is thick
and green, there need be no white-washing.</p>

<p>The plants will need a liberal supply of water every
day. We have so constantly cautioned the operator on
administering this element, that a repetition here is unnecessary.
Sprinkle them well with the syringe or engine
in the evenings about sundown, four or five times
a week, and strictly observe that none of them are
omitted; for where there are such, it is probable they
are attacked by the red spider. If any of these are
detected, syringe them powerfully morning and evening.
Water is most effectual in their destruction, and most
congenial to the plants. Give regular fumigations to
destroy the green-fly. Wherever there is dust or foulness
contracted on the foliage, wash all clean with
sponge and water; for on these insects are harboured
in such quantities that they, in a short time, would
overrun all the plants in the house. Keeping the house
constantly clean, the plants clear of decayed leaves
and every thing of a corroding nature, and duly syringing
them, is the surest method of not being much
troubled with insects.</p>

<p>For repotting plants, see next month; except those
that you are fostering to a great extent, such as
<i>Alstr&oelig;m&egrave;rias</i>, <i>Calceol&agrave;rias</i>, or any herbaceous plants
that require great encouragement to make them flower
well. These should always be repotted, as soon as the
roots come to be round the outside of the ball.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="Green-House3" id="Green-House3"><span class="antiqua">Green-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>APRIL.</i></h3>


<p>Regarding the shifting or repotting of plants, the directions
given last month may be followed. If the
plants are not shifted that require it, get them done as
soon as possible, for they will soon get into a luxuriant
state of growth, and then it would not be advisable to
shift them. Those that were repotted last month will
have taken fresh root in the new soil, and the advantage
will soon be perceptible. In order to strengthen
the plants, and keep them from becoming drawn and
spindly, admit large portions of air every mild day. Indeed
there will be very few days in this month, that a
little air may not be given, always observing to divide
the quantity regularly over the house, in cool nights
closing in time. About the end of the month an abundance
of air is indispensable, leaving the sashes and
doors open every mild night, that the plants may be
inured to the open exposure they will have in a few
weeks.</p>


<h4>WATERING.</h4>

<p>As the season advances and vegetation increases,
the waterings will require to be more copious and more
frequent. Look over all plants minutely every day,
and with judicious care supply their wants. Those
that are of a soft shrubby nature, and in a free-growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
state, will require a larger portion at one time than
those of a hard texture, which may only want it every
two or three days. The weather and situation
in some instances may require a modification of
these directions. Plants in general will not suffer
so soon from being a little dry as from being over-watered.
The health and beauty of the foliage of the
plants may be much improved by syringing them freely
three evenings in the week, except in moist weather,
when it ought not to be done. The ravages of many
insects also will be retarded, especially mildew and
red spider, which will be entirely destroyed. If the
red spider is on any of the plants, particularly take
them aside evening and morning, and give them a good
dashing with water through the syringe. Where there
is mildew, after syringing the plant, dust it on the affected
parts with flowers of sulphur, and set them for a
few days where they will be sheltered from the wind,
after which wash off the sulphur. If the cure is not
complete, renew the dose. Always sweep out and dry
up the water in the house when any is spilt. The succulent
plants will be in want of a little water about
once a week, but do not overwater them, as there is
not heat enough to absorb much moisture. If the soil is
damp, it is quite sufficient.</p>


<h4>ORANGES, LEMONS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>Will in many instances about the end of this month
be showing flowers or flower buds. They must under
these circumstances have plenty of air to prevent them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
from falling off when entirely exposed. The reason
that we see so much fine blossom falling to the ground
where the trees are brought out of the house in May,
is from the confinement they have had. Where there
is a convenience of giving air from the back of the
Green-house, it should always be given in mild days,
especially in those houses that have a recess back from
the top of the sashes, for even if the sashes are let down
every day, still the house will not be properly ventilated.
Any plants that are sickly and intended to be planted
in the garden next month to renovate their growth,
may be cut back, (if not already done,) as far as is required
to give the tree a handsome form, taking care
not to cut below the graft or inoculation. Let the
operation be done with a fine saw and sharp knife,
smoothing the amputations that are made by the saw;
and if they are large, put a little well made clay over
the wound, to prevent the air from mortifying the shoot.
Turpentine is preferable to clay, not being subject to
crack or fall off by the weather.</p>

<p>If there are any <i>Lagerstr&oelig;mias</i>, <i>Pomegranate</i>, or <i>Hydr&agrave;ngeas</i>
in the cellar, they should be brought out about
the first of the month, and planted in their respective
situations. Give the <i>Hydr&agrave;ngea</i> a very shady spot. It
does not require one ray of the sun, providing it has
plenty of air, and do not plant it into soil that has been
lately manured. A large plant must have great supplies
of water in dry weather. If the plant is very thick, the
oldest branches may be thinned out, but do not cut out
any of the young shoots, as they contain the embryo of
the flower. <i>Lagerstr&oelig;mias</i> will flower abundantly with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>out
pruning, but to have fine large spikes of flowers,
cut in the wood of last year to about three eyes from
the wood of the preceding year; by this they will be
much finer. <i>Pomegranates</i> will only require a little of
the superfluous wood cut out. Perhaps some of them
may be desired to flower in pots or tubs during summer:
the balls will admit of being much reduced, and
by this a pot or tub very little larger will do for them.
Do not give much water until they begin to grow.</p>


<h4>MYRTLES AND OLEANDERS.</h4>

<p>If any of these have grown irregularly, and are not
headed down or otherwise pruned, as directed last
month, they should now be done. Oleanders are very
subject to the white scaly insect, and before the heat
of summer begins, they should be completely cleansed.
This insect is likewise found on <i>Myrtles</i>, which are worse
to clean, and ought to be minutely examined twice
every year. We have observed mildew on these shrubs,
which makes the foliage brown and unsightly. If it is
detected in time, syringing is an effectual remedy.</p>


<h4>GERANIUMS.</h4>

<p>Some of the earliest blooming kinds of these will now
begin to flower, and the sun will greatly deteriorate
their rich colours where they are near the glass with a
south aspect. The glass should be white-washed,
which will cast a thin shade over them, and prolong the
duration of the bloom, but if they are above five feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
from the glass, white-washing is not requisite. The
strong kinds will be growing very luxuriantly, and require
liberal supplies of water. When syringing, do
not sprinkle the flowers, as it would make the colours
intermingle with each other, and cause them to decay
prematurely. If they have been properly attended to
in that respect, it may be dispensed with after they
have generally come in flower, which will not be until
about the first of May.</p>


<h4>HERBACEOUS PLANTS AND BULBOUS ROOTS.</h4>

<p>If any of the herbaceous plants were neglected to be
divided last month, do not omit it now. They will not
flower so well if potted entire, and their growth by this
time will be much hurt, if not carefully shaded from the
sun. After dividing, sprinkle gently with water three
times a day, until they have taken fresh root, when
they can be put amongst the other plants.</p>

<p><i>Cape Bulbs.</i> Those that flowered late in autumn, as
soon as the foliage begins to decay, may be set aside,
and the water withheld by degrees. When the foliage
is entirely gone, and the roots dry, clear them from
the earth, and after laying exposed in the shade for a
few days to dry, pack them up in dry moss, with their
respective names attached, until August, when they
may be again potted. Treat those that are in flower
the same as directed in last month.</p>

<p><i>Dutch Roots.</i> All the species and varieties of these
that have been kept in the Green-house during winter,
will now be done flowering; the water should be with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>drawn
gradually from them; and then the pots turned
on their sides to ripen the bulbs. Or, a superior method
is, where there is the convenience of a garden, to
select a bed not much exposed. Turn the balls out of
the pots and plant them; the roots will ripen better this
way than any other. Have them correctly marked,
that no error may take place. They can be lifted with
the other garden bulbs.</p>


<h4>FLOWERING PLANTS.</h4>

<p>The best situation for most plants while in flower, is
where they are shaded from the sun, and fully exposed
to the air. <i>Primroses</i>, both European and Chinese,
flower best, and the colours are finest when the plants
are in the front of the house, and entirely shaded from
the sun. The Chinese <i>Az&agrave;leas</i> and <i>Rhodod&eacute;ndrons</i> require,
while in flower, a similar situation. Have all
the shoots tied naturally to neat rods, and keep them
clear from others by elevating them on empty pots, or
any other substitute. See that there are no insect
upon them; for they make a miserable contrast with
flowers. The <i>C&aacute;lla &aelig;thiopica</i> should stand in water
when in flower, and even before flowering they will be
much strengthened by it.</p>


<h4>INSECTS.</h4>

<p>Insects will on some plants be very perplexing. The
weather may admit of those that are infected to be
taken out of doors, and put into a frame in any way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that is most convenient. Fumigating them about half
an hour, if the day is calm, will be sufficient; but
if windy, they will take an hour. When done, syringe
them well, and put them in their respective situations.
By the above method, the house will not be made disagreeable
with the fumes of tobacco.</p>

<p>Tie up neatly all the climbing plants. Keep those
that are running up the rafters of the house close to the
longitudinal wires. As previously observed, running
plants should not be taken across the house, except in
some instances where it can be done over the pathway,
otherwise it shades the house too much. Clear
off all decayed leaves, and all contracted foulness, that
the house and plants may in this month have an enlivening
aspect, as it is undoubtedly one of the most interesting
seasons of the year in the Green-house.</p>


<h4>FLOWERING STOCKS.</h4>

<p>Those that have been kept in the Green-house, or in
frames, should be planted into beds or the borders,
where they will seed better than if kept in the pots.
The method generally adopted is to select the plants
that are intended for seed; plant the different kinds
distinctly and separately; then take a few double
flowering plants of each kind, which plant round their respective
single varieties that are to be kept for seed.
Whenever any of the colours sport, that is, become
spotted or striped with other colours, pull these up, and
destroy them, for they will soon degenerate the whole,
and ought never to be seen in collections that have any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
pretensions to purity. Many have been the plans recommended
as the best for saving, and growing from
seed the double varieties of German stock. In every
method we have tried we have been successful and unsuccessful;
although we generally practise planting the
double kinds beside the single, where they are intended
for seed. We have no scientific reason for it; not seeing
what influence these monsters of flowers can have
over a flower where the male and female organs are
perfect; which in these are wanting. Some say that
the semi-double sorts are best: we have likewise found
them both abortive and fruitful in the desired results.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Flower_Garden3" id="Flower_Garden3"><span class="antiqua">Flower Garden.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>APRIL.</i></h3>


<p>The ambition of every attentive gardener, during
this month, is to be at the head of every department,
and over every spot. The operator's activity in this
month regulates the whole season. Every weed ought
to be cut down as soon as it appears, and the proverbial
saying will be realized, "a garden that is well
kept is easily kept." A wet day need cause no loss of
time. Prepare rods, bands, and tallies, to be in readiness
when required. Damp weather should always be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
taken to prick out or transplant annuals, or stocks, but
by no means go on the borders while they are wet. If
it cannot be done by keeping on the walks, defer it until
they are in a proper state. One day of laborious
attention just now will save two in the heat of summer.
Many in the height of bustle never finish properly as
they proceed, which is the worst of practices. Every
operation ought to be completely and properly finished
before another is taken in hand, which will ultimately
prove the quickest and best method to work upon.</p>

<p>Let digging, pruning, hoeing, raking, &amp;c. be done as
expeditiously as strength will allow; that the time may
be devoted for a few weeks to the beautifying of the
garden by sowing and planting.</p>


<h4>ANNUALS.</h4>

<p>Those that are tender and were sown last month,
according to directions, will be ready to prick out into
another light hot-bed, about two feet high, prepared as
directed in February. Keep them a few inches apart
to let the air circulate. Give them frequent sprinklings
with water, and shade them with a mat for a few days
until they have taken fresh root; then give them plenty
of air, and by the first of next month expose them night
and day to harden the plants for the open ground. A
few of the annual seeds of every description, and of
every country and climate, may be sown any time after
the middle of the month. If the season prove favourable
they will do well; but reserving a part to sow about
the 15th of May, will guard against every extreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Those that have come above ground should be
thinned out, the dwarf-growing kinds to two or three
inches, and the large sorts to four or five inches apart;
or they may be only separated about an inch, going
over them again in a few weeks; when a few might be
taken of those that will bear removing, and plant them
in vacant spaces that require filling up. All the varieties
of French and African Marygold answer best when
transplanted, likewise the species of <i>Core&ograve;psis</i> that
were sown in autumn. The varieties of <i>Ten-week
Stock</i>, <i>Balsams</i>, <i>Coxcombs</i>, and other strong growing
sorts, generally flower stronger when replanted.</p>


<h4>BIENNIALS AND PERENNIALS.</h4>

<p>Any biennials that are intended to be removed, and
not done last month, must not be delayed longer. The
roots of many of them will be very strong, and if possible
a cloudy day should be chosen for the operation.
Give copious waterings in the evenings until they begin
to grow. When the sun is strong, they must be shaded
by a piece of board, shingle, or any similar substitute,
for some days. When the seeds of these are sown, they
should be distinctly marked. The initial B. is the most
appropriate.</p>

<p><i>Perennials.</i> For a limited description of several
genera and species, see last month. Those that have
not been divided and replanted, where large, they should
be done directly, if the weather is dry. They must be
carefully watered, and shaded as above directed for
<i>Biennials</i>.</p>

<h4>DAHLIAS.</h4>

<p><i>D&aacute;hlia sup&eacute;rflua</i>, or what is now called <i>Georg&igrave;ana vari&aacute;bilis</i>,
is one of the most fashionable and popular
hardy herbaceous plants of the present day. The varieties
of the present species are almost endless. The
double kinds only are cultivated, the single varieties
having been thrown aside. Several collections in Europe
contain upwards of three hundred double varieties,
of every colour and taste, occupying more than two acres
of ground. It will be difficult to specify the finest; but
in this country the dwarf-growing sorts are preferred.
To make them flower freely, they should be planted in
poor heavy soil. From the end of this month to the
middle of May, take the roots from their winter quarters
to the garden, and with a spade make a hole sufficiently
wide and deep to receive the crowns of the
roots one inch deeper than the surface of the ground,
cutting off with a sharp knife the old stumps close to
the eyes. They have the finest effect in rows; plant
them four feet apart in the row, and the rows six feet
asunder. Individual plants of a dwarf nature look extremely
well. The best one for this is the <i>Dwarf Globe
Crimson</i>, and is perhaps the finest that is known, being
prolific, compact, beautiful, and very dwarf, never exceeding
three feet: if properly grown, <i>P&uacute;lla el&egrave;cta</i>, <i>Fam&aelig;a</i>,
and <i>Zen&ograve;</i>, are also fine dwarf sorts; as tall
growing kinds <i>Etna</i>; <i>Imperi&ograve;sa</i>; <i>Cicer&oacute;</i>; <i>Coc&agrave;de</i>; <i>Cambridge
Surprise</i>; <i>Dutchess of Wellington</i>; <i>Countess of Liverpool</i>;
<i>Barret's William Fourth</i>; <i>True Mountain of Snow</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
<i>Di&agrave;na</i>; <i>Crimson Bonnet</i>; and <i>Ex&iacute;mia</i>, are all superb,
and at present the highest in estimation. For the
names of more of the finest varieties, with their colour,
see Catalogue at the end of the work.</p>

<p>When the roots become very large, they ought to be
divided, and in dry seasons they require to be liberally
supplied with water to keep them growing. If their growth
is obstructed, the flowering will be imperfect. Where
they are grown to any extent, it would be advisable to
put up a large hot-bed about the end of March, and
plant them close together therein, about the beginning
of April, which would immediately cause them to grow.
Give plenty of air, and about the middle of May plant
them in the borders, beds, or rows, which will in cool
seasons cause them to flower earlier.</p>

<p>The flowers are from three to eight inches in diameter.
There ought to be a few of the most distinct and
superb varieties, in every garden. Some individuals
consider the <i>Anemon&eacute;-flowered</i> varieties the finest; but
those who never saw a <i>D&aacute;hlia</i> flower of any character,
would, in our opinion, chose the large petaled
flowers. The <i>Anemon&eacute;-flowered</i> sorts likewise are not
so large in flower as the other varieties.</p>

<p>The foliage has no particular attraction about it;
the stems look strong, but are soft in substance. If seeds
are sown on a hot-bed in March, most of them will
flower the same year, by transplanting in the garden
about the end of May; but the fine double kinds seldom
produce seeds.</p>

<h4>CHINA ROSES.</h4>

<p>From the first to the middle of this month is the best
time to plant the varieties of Chinese roses. If they
are to be removed out of the ground, the earlier in the
month the better; but where they are in pots, the precise
time is not so material. There are about seventy
varieties, including the species of these in cultivation;
all of them do extremely well in this country, growing
freely, and flowering abundantly in the open air. A
few of them require protection during winter. The
List at the end of the work will contain all the finest
varieties; but as they are not generally known, and the
greater part of them highly deserving a situation in
every garden, a few limited specific observations is obviously
desirable to those who are not acquainted with
their beauty and fragrance.</p>

<p>No. 1. <i>R&ograve;sa &iacute;ndica</i>, common China or daily. From
the last name an error has taken place, that it blooms
every day. In one sense of the word it does. Plants
that are young, and in good ground, will grow and
flower constantly from the end of April until the buds
are killed with frost; but they will never flower when
not growing; the bloom being produced on the young
wood. The flower is about three inches in diameter,
of a dark blush or rose colour, petals large, and loose,
between a semi-double and double, and perfectly
hardy.</p>

<p>No. 2. *<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a><i>Rose Animated</i>, daily, is a very fine rose, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
merits are appreciated by those who have it in their
collections. It is more double, and better formed than
No. 1, and partakes of the fragrance of No. 8, is perfectly
hardy, colour a fine blush, grows freely, and
flowers abundantly; and is coming into great repute.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Those marked thus * we have grown from seed.</p></div>

<p>No. 3. <i>Rosa Ind&igrave;ca m&iacute;nor</i>, is the smallest of the China
roses that we are familiar with; about the end of April or
beginning of May it is completely covered with pretty
little flowers, and much admired for its diminutiveness:
colour same as No. 1.</p>

<p>No. 4. <i>Rosa Bengal elong&aacute;ta</i>, named from the foliage
being more elongate than the other common roses. It
grows and flowers freely, petals large, colour light red,
very distinguishable from any of the other sorts.</p>

<p>No. 5. <i>Rosa belle Chinese</i>, is a beautiful French rose,
and blooms in great abundance; flowers large and double,
colour when first expanded pink, and changes to
crimson, making a striking appearance, and greatly
admired.</p>

<p>No. 6. <i>Rosa la tendere japonica</i>, an erect growing rose,
of a handsome purple colour, with large petals; much
like the garden velvet rose.</p>

<p>No. 7. <i>Rosa belle vibert</i>, does not produce so large
flowers as the three last mentioned; but they are very
double, blooming abundantly in the latter part of summer;
colour very dark, and by some called the Black
China Rose.</p>

<p>No. 8. <i>Rosa odor&agrave;ta</i>, or Tea-rose, celebrated in this
country for its fragrance being similar to fine Hyson tea.
It justly deserves the preference of all the China roses,
for the delicacy of its flavour. The flowers are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
cream coloured blush, the petals round and full, forming
a very large rose; when full blown, it is pendulous.
It will withstand the winter of the middle states with a
little protection, such as straw, box, or barrel; requires
very rich light soil.</p>

<p>No. 9. <i>Rosa Florence</i>, or Scarlet-tea. This rose partakes
of the fragrance of No. 8, is perfectly hardy, grows
freely, and flowers profusely. The flower is well formed,
very double, and a distinct variety from any that
we know. The flower is lightest when first expanded.</p>

<p>No. 10. <i>Rose, Purple-tea.</i> We have not found how this
name has originated: but when the plant known in our
collections under that name is compared, there is no
difference between it and No. 9.</p>

<p>No. 11. <i>Rosa odor&agrave;ta &aacute;lba</i>, or White-tea, is not so odorous
as No. 8, but blooms more profusely, and grows
more freely. The beautiful and neat appearance of the
buds, when half expanded, is not surpassed; and when full
blown, they are a fine delicate white. The bush in
that state is showy, much admired, and scarce; we are
not positive of its being hardy.</p>

<p>No. 12. <i>Rosa Bengal</i>, or Yellow-tea, is a very free
flowerer, the shape of the flower is more like No. 8.
than any of the others; the petals are large and gracefully
set, having a peculiar scent or flavour, and is of a
sulphur colour. We cannot say as to its being hardy,
but suppose it as much so as No. 8.</p>

<p>No. 13. <i>Rosa Venella</i>, or Venella Scented-tea, is undoubtedly
a handsome rose, and has many admirers;
colour a bloody velvet; flowers large and very double,
rising in the centre more than any of the others; bloom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>ing
freely, and of pleasant flavour; rendering it altogether
a desirable rose.</p>

<p>No. 14. <i>Rosa belle de monza.</i> The flower of this
rose is flatter than any of the other sorts; the petals are
regularly laid over each other, making it very compact;
it is about four inches in diameter when well grown;
the plant is of quick growth, free in flowering, darker
in colour than No. 1, equally as hardy, and ought to
have a situation in every garden where roses are
grown.</p>

<p>No. 15. <i>Rosa amar&aacute;nthe</i>, is a showy brilliant scarlet
rose, flower compact, and of a moderate size.</p>

<p>No. 16. *<i>Rosa Clint&oacute;nia</i>, is a good rose, and in a favourable
situation will produce abundantly large, round, and
compact flowers, differing in shape from any of the
others; colour similar to the provins rose.</p>

<p>No. 17. <i>Rosa semperfl&ograve;rens pl&egrave;no</i>, or sanguinea, is a celebrated
rose, the foliage small, and of a reddish appearance.
The flower is well shaped, and of a blood colour;
wood of a slender growth, requires some protection
in winter, or it will die to the surface of the ground;
delights in sandy soil. This rose is frequently called
anemone-flowered, though in no respects similar to the
character of an anemone-flower. The <i>Otaheite</i> rose is
of the same colour, but very inferior.</p>

<p>No. 18. *<i>Rosa purple sanguinea</i>, is of a purple colour,
same in shape as No. 17, but in size larger; is a good
flowerer, making a fine variety. We do not know any
similar to it.</p>

<p>No. 19. <i>Rosa grandv&agrave;l</i>, is a magnificent rose; flower full
and large, petals closely set, colour dark crimson. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
wood and leaves are like the <i>Hamilton</i> rose, but it grows
and flowers more freely. It is scarce.</p>

<p>No. 20. <i>Rosa Indica &aacute;lba pl&egrave;no</i>, or white China, is a rose
of free growth, abundant in flower, and pure white,
which renders it very desirable; is larger than No. 1,
is greatly admired, and rare; requires rich light soil.</p>

<p>No. 21. <i>Rosa Magnifier</i>, <i>magnificent</i>, or <i>magn&igrave;fica</i>. It is
known under all these names. The general appearance
of the plant resembles No. 19, but the flowers in shape
and colour are similar to the garden Provins rose, and
nearly as large.</p>

<p>No. 22. *<i>Rosa florab&ugrave;nda multipl&egrave;x</i>. This rose is very
correctly named, although the plant is of a moderate
stature. The whole is covered with immense clusters
of various coloured flowers, changing from pink to dark
crimson; the flowers very double, and greatly admired.</p>

<p>No. 23. *<i>Rosa flam&aelig;a</i>, has a very striking appearance,
is of a flame colour, and distinct from any other of the
China roses; blooms freely, and is a little fragrant,
which makes it desirable.</p>

<p>No. 24. *<i>Rosa Hibb&egrave;rtia</i>, is a superb rose of a light red
colour; flower of a common size, double and compact,
very fragrant, and abundant in bloom. The buds are
of a particular shape, being flat at the extremity where
others are pointed. It is highly deserving of a situation,
and universally admired.</p>

<p>No. 25. *<i>Rosa Jacks&oacute;nia</i>, is deep red, large, and very
double, of luxuriant growth; is more spiny and elastic
than any of the China roses that have come under our
observation. The plant altogether is unique in its
character, and flowers profusely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 26. <i>R. Adamsônia</i>, is dwarf growing; has flowers
of a beautiful purple velvet colour, inclining to black;
and is much admired. When well grown, it will bloom
freely.</p>

<p>No. 27. *<i>Rosa Webest&egrave;ria.</i><a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> None of the China roses approaches
this, except <i>Hortensia</i>, and it is much inferior.
The rose is very double, and particularly well formed;
colour similar to No. 8, with a beautiful rich blush in
the centre, flowing to the extremity of the petals. It
blooms profusely, and grows freely in light rich soil.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> Named in honour of D. Webster, Esq. whose productions deserve a place in
every library; and this plant a spot in every garden.</p></div>

<p>No. 28. <i>Rosa gig&aacute;ntea.</i> Without exception, this is the
handsomest shaped China rose that has come under
our observation, the colour dark crimson, with a few
shades through it. The centre is full set; petals regular
and large, the flower very double, plant strong,
growing and free blooming&mdash;it is scarce.</p>

<p>No. 29. <i>Rosa Washington</i>,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> is a very good and distinct
variety; the foliage is pale green with red nerves;
flower full and compact, the extremity of the petals dark
red, the bottom white; showing, when the flower is full
expanded, a white centre, and is frequently a little
striped; grows well, and blooms freely, in light sandy
soil.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> Originated on the substantial establishment of D. &amp; C. Landreth, and called
by them "Scarlet and White."</p></div>

<p>No. 30. *<i>Rosa calyxif&ograve;lia</i>. The calyx of this rose has
large leaflets attached to it. It blooms very early, and
is of a deep crimson colour, with recurved petals, which
give it a singular and beautiful appearance. The young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
shoots and leaves are of a purple hue. It grows and
flowers freely, and is quite characteristic, and surpasses
any we know for flowering early in the Green-house or
Rooms.</p>

<p>No. 31. <i>Rosa Montez&ugrave;ma</i> (Mexican-rose.) This is
an esteemed variety, with large double flowers of a red
colour, and when the flowers begin to fade they become
darker; it is of a strong growing and hardy nature,
much admired, and scarce.</p>

<p>No. 32. <i>Rosa hort&eacute;nsia.</i> The buds of this rose are
very beautiful before expansion, and when fully expanded,
are of a fine colour, assimilated to No. 8;
flowers large in proportion to the growth of the plant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These roses are all of a shrubby nature, and the
finest flowering varieties that have come under our observation
and culture. The China roses generally are
not completely double, though going under the name
of double flowers, and having the appearance of such.
Those that are mentioned above as <i>double</i> and <i>very double</i>
are those that are more double than No. 1, which
is a rose that is generally known. The whole of them
are much admired, and being now of great variety in
colour, shade and aspect, constitute a valuable addition
to the Flower-garden. A bed of varieties planted
therein in good light rich soil, and well dressed by hoeing
deep, raking, &amp;c. during the early stage of their
growth every season, will form an ornament varied in
colour, unrivalled, and as yet not found in our Flower-gardens.
Their nature agrees so well with our summer
seasons, that it will not surprise us to see, in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
years, selections of them planted in rows or hedges,
dividing the compartments in our gardens.</p>

<p>They are all hardy, but of those that are not perfectly
so, we have mentioned the required protection. Any
of them that have not been proved hardy in your
collections, it would be extremely injudicious to leave
them exposed the first winter after planting out. Caution
is necessary on every unknown point; therefore,
we would recommend to give them slight protection, by
a covering of straw, mats, boxes, &amp;c. and if they appear
to withstand the winter in perfect safety, they will
not need again to be covered.</p>

<p>The best season of the year for pruning them is
about the first of this month. In doing so it is not advisable
to shorten any of the young shoots, except in
cutting off the injured parts, that being the wood most
productive of bloom; but where there is old stinted wood,
it should be cut out as close to the surface of the
ground as the other parts of the bush will permit, with
any other of the oldest wood that is too crowded. If
the plants have been long established, dig in amongst
their roots a little well decomposed manure, and stir
and hoe them frequently during the summer.</p>


<h4>CLIMBING ROSES.</h4>

<p>No. 1. <i>Rosa Champney&agrave;na.</i> This celebrated rose has
a situation in almost every garden in our city, and forms
a great ornament, flowering very profusely in immense
clusters from May to November. Many of these hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>ing
more than thirty buds upon them of a light pink
colour, it is sometimes called "Pink Cluster." It is of
rapid growth, and does well for covering arbours,
fences, or any unsightly object. The foliage is of a
lucid green, and the wood very strong in growth. This
rose is at present one of the most abundant in flower,
the easiest of cultivation, (growing in any exposure,)
and in every respect is highly deserving of attention.</p>

<p>No. 2. <i>Rosa blush Noisetti&agrave;</i> is very similar to No. 1.
in habit; the flowers are lighter in colour, and a little
larger; but the plant does not flower so profusely during
the heat of the season. There is a variety of <i>Noisettia</i>
in our gardens, known from this by the bud being
more rounded, and another under the name of <i>Charles
10th</i>, which has fine large flowers of a dark blush
colour.</p>

<p>No. 3. <i>Rosa red Noisetti&agrave;</i>, or what we consider more
properly <i>Scarlet cluster</i>. It is very distinct from any other
of the Noisettias in habit. It is an excellent variety,
and blooms abundantly; of a scarlet colour; forming a
fine contrast with the two last, which are light in colour,
and though not generally known is very desirable.</p>

<p>No. 4. <i>Rosa mosch&agrave;ta</i>, musk-scented, or white cluster,
is an esteemed rose both for profusion of flower and
agreeableness in fragrance. It is not of so rapid growth
as the three previous, and may be kept as a bush;
though it will grow to a considerable height if protected
by a wall or close fence, being tacked thereto.
Where kept as a bush, in very severe winters, it is the
better of a slight covering, and is the latest flowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
rose in the garden. The flowers are frequently on the
same bush single, semi-double, and double, but mostly
semi-double.</p>

<p>No. 5. <i>Rosa mosch&agrave;ta sup&eacute;rba</i>, or superb white cluster.
This in habit and appearance is the same as No. 4,
only the roses are double, and never vary; which makes
it a very superior rose. It is highly esteemed and
scarce.</p>

<p>No. 6. <i>Rosa Aralie Noisetti&agrave;.</i> This has been called
by some <i>Purple Noisetti&agrave;</i>, (which is a very different rose,
and not generally known.) In growth it is similar to No.
4, and could be kept in the same manner. The flowers
are of a dark pink colour, very prolific, but not so large
as No. 2.</p>

<p>These are all what are termed with us ever-blooming
roses, being in flower from May until the buds are
destroyed by frost. They should be pruned about the
first of this month. The young wood is most productive
of bloom; where the branches are too crowded,
cut out the oldest wood as close to the ground as is
practicable, and any of the dead branches. The shoots
when tied to the trellis, arbour, wall, or fence, should
be about six inches clear. The branches when made
fast to their support ought to be in direct lines, which
must at all times be strictly observed. It is very unsightly
to see shoots trained crooked, or over each
other, and, unsightly or unscientifical as it may be, it
is too prevalent in every garden.</p>

<p>No. 7. <i>R. Bourb&ograve;n</i> is a double rose of brilliant red
colour, petals large, stiff, and neatly set; the flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
about the size of a common Provins rose, and finely
scented; grows freely. The wood is strong, and undoubtedly
it is the finest climbing rose that has come
under our observation, and is highly admired.</p>

<p>No. 8. R. <i>Boursault</i>. This rose is much thought of
in Europe. It is of a purple colour (and once called
<i>Purpurea</i>), has a little fragrance, flower nearly the size
of No. 7; wood more slender, and of very rapid growth,
and capable of covering a large space. When in flower
it is very showy. The old wood is of a purple colour.
There is a white variety of it.</p>

<p>No. 9. R. <i>Lisle</i>, is of a light pink colour, about the
shape and size of No. 8, grows freely, and flowers
abundantly. This and No. 8. are the hardiest climbing
roses that we know.</p>

<p>No. 10. R. <i>microphylla</i>. This rose is unique in every
character, resembling No. 21. more than any other.
The foliage is very small and neat, and the calyx thick
and bristly. The flowers are produced at the extremity
of the young shoots in twos or threes, according to the
strength of the plant; they are large and double; the
exterior petals large and full; those of the interior are
very short and thick set; the colour in the centre is
dark, shading lighter towards the exterior; the spines
are in pairs on each side of the compound leaves. It
is perfectly hardy, and greatly esteemed, and not so
subject to be attacked by insects as other roses.</p>

<p>No. 11. R. <i>Franklinia</i>, or Cluster-tea, generally flowers
well in May and June, but during the remainder of the
season the heat appears to be too strong for it, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
buds dropping off before expansion. The flower bud
is larger than that of the Tea-rose; the petals large but
loose, colour light blush.</p>

<p>No. 12. R. <i>B&aacute;nksi&aelig;</i>, or Lady Banks' rose, is a free
growing kind, and has a lucid green foliage; flowers
small white clusters with pink centre, very double, and
sweet scented; in bloom during May. From what we
have seen of it, the spring months appear too changeable
for perfecting all its bloom, many falling off from
the chilliness of the nights. The plant naturally is an
evergreen, but in our city is deciduous; grows best in
sandy soil, and should be protected by mats during
winter.</p>

<p>No. 13. R. <i>B&aacute;nksi&aelig; l&ugrave;tea pl&eacute;no</i>. The habit and foliage
of this are the same as No. 12, and whether hardy
or not we have not proved. In Europe it is considered
more hardy than the preceding variety. The flowers
are larger, of a fine gold yellow, very double, and neatly
set. It is considered very pretty.</p>

<p>No. 14. R. <i>multifl&ograve;ra</i>, was amongst the first climbing
roses that was planted in this city, and was so highly
admired, that twenty dollars were given for one plant.
It bears its flowers in close clusters on the wood of
last year; the colour is a deep blush; petals thickly set,
making it a close and compact small rose; blooming in
June. It is losing its celebrity, and giving place to
<i>Champn&egrave;y</i>, <i>Nois&egrave;ttia</i>, <i>Grev&igrave;llii</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>No. 15. R. <i>white multifl&ograve;ra</i>. In all respects same
as No. 14, except in flower, which is much lighter, but
not a pure white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 16. R. <i>scarlet multifl&ograve;ra</i>, is darker in colour than
No. 14, but is not properly a scarlet flower.</p>

<p>No. 17. R. <i>purple multifl&ograve;ra</i>. We suspect that there
is some confusion in this plant being confounded either
with <i>Scarlet multifl&ograve;ra</i> or with <i>Grev&igrave;llii</i>. Plants imported
as such have proved to be the latter.</p>

<p>No. 18. R. <i>Grev&igrave;llii</i>, is a very curious rose, flowered
the first time with us in June 1830. It is of the variety
of No. 14, and of China origin; growth free and luxuriant;
leaves large and deeply nerved; flowers in large
clusters, almost every eye of the wood of last year producing
one cluster, having on it from eight to twenty
roses, according to the state of the plant, each rose
expanding differently in colour or shade. Many suppose
that they expand all of the same colour, and change
afterwards. This is not the case. We have seen them
white, pink, red, purple, and various other shades when
the bloom expanded; and on two clusters we have observed
twenty-two distinct shades of colour. In fact,
it is a complete nondescript, having roses, single, semi-double,
and double, large and small, and every colour
between white and purple, forming, in every garden
where it is planted, a wonder of the vegetable world.
It is very hardy; an eastern aspect will answer it best,
preserving the flowers from the direct rays of the sun,
which will keep the colours purer. We readily recommend
it to every lover of <i>Flora</i>.</p>

<p>No. 19. R. <i>arv&eacute;nsis sc&aacute;ndens multipl&egrave;x</i>, or double Ayrshire.
We imported this rose last year, as being a very
double blush, sweet-scented variety. It is highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
valued, and said to be more rapid in growth than any
other variety, and likewise a profuse flowerer. As far
as we know it remains to be proved how it will agree
with our climate, and have its high characters substantiated;
although we have no reason to doubt the
authority we received it from.</p>

<p>No. 20. R. <i>semperv&iacute;rens plen&ograve;</i>. This is a most handsome
double white rose. The strong shoots of last
year will produce a large cluster of flowers from almost
every eye, and as a profuse flowering double white
climbing rose we have seen none to surpass it. It
grows freely, the foliage and wood pure green, leaves
much nerved.</p>

<p>No. 21. R. <i>bracte&agrave;ta plen&ograve;</i>, double Macartney, is a
very fine large double white variety, with strongly marked
red edged petals; blooming from May to July. It
is very scarce, and grows best in sandy soil.</p>

<p>The best time for pruning those roses which only
bloom once in the season, and are of a climbing habit,
is immediately after flowering, cutting out all the old
wood that has produced flowers, thereby invigorating
the young wood that is to bear the flowers the ensuing
year; and the stronger the wood of this year can be
made to grow, the finer and more profuse will be the
flowers. The plants of Nos. 12, 14, 18, and the intermediate
varieties, have been pruned on a wrong system.
In place of giving them a general dressing in spring,
they ought to have it immediately after flowering; the
old wood cut out, leaving only the young and such as
is of a healthy nature. Avoid crowding them together,
and tie them all straight and regular. Never top the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
shoots except where there is a supply of wood wanted.
In spring the only dressing requisite is to cut off the
injured shoots or branches, making good the tyings
that have given way.</p>

<p>Trellises for these roses are generally made too
wide; the shoots cannot be neatly kept to them. They
ought never to exceed nine inches between each spar
or rod.</p>

<p>There are several species and varieties of climbing
roses of high standing in character, but not being perfectly
known to us in regard to hardiness, &amp;c. we forbear
making any remarks upon them, knowing that
much exaggeration exists.</p>


<h4>CLIMBING PLANTS.</h4>

<p>As shade is much required in this country, and plants
suitable for covering arbours, &amp;c. eagerly sought for,
we will make a few remarks on those which are preferred
for their beauty, growth, hardiness, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Atrag&egrave;ne alp&igrave;na</i>, is a free growing deciduous shrub,
with large blush-coloured flowers, which continue
blooming from May to July; has small pinnated foliage.</p>

<p><i>Cl&eacute;matis vitic&eacute;lla pulch&eacute;lla</i>, or double purple virgin's
bower, is an esteemed climbing plant; of rapid growth,
with large flowers in great profusion from June to September.
There are several varieties of the above, two
of them single, and it is said that there is likewise a
double red.</p>

<p><i>C. fl&aacute;mmula</i>, sweet scented virgin's bower, is of very
rapid growth. Established plants will grow from twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to forty feet in one season, producing at the axils of the
young shoots large panicles of small white flowers of
exquisite fragrance; the leaves are compound pinnate;
in bloom from June to November, but in June, July,
September, and October, the flowers are in great profusion,
perfuming the whole garden. This is one of
the best climbing hardy plants that we know, and it
ought to have a situation in every garden.</p>

<p><i>C. Virgi&agrave;na</i>, is of rapid growth, and well adapted for
arbours; flowers small white in axillary panicles, di&oelig;cious,
leaves ternate, segments cordate, acute, coarsely
toothed and lobed, in bloom from June to August. A
native, and a little fragrant.</p>

<p><i>C. fl&ograve;rida plen&ograve;</i>, is a fine free flowering plant, though
generally considered a shrub, is more herbaceous than
shrubby; the flowers are large double white; in growth
will not exceed ten feet in one season.</p>

<p><i>Glycine frut&eacute;scens</i>, a beautiful native climbing shrub,
known in our gardens under that name, but is properly
<i>Wist&egrave;ria frut&eacute;scens</i>. It has large pendulous branches of
blue (leguminose) flowers, blooming from May to August;
pinnated leaves with nine ovate downy leaflets;
grows freely.</p>

<p><i>Glycine chin&eacute;nsis</i>, is given to Wist&egrave;ria, and is the finest
climbing shrub of the phaseolious tribe. The flowers
are light blue, in long nodding many-flowered racemose
spikes, blooming from May to August profusely; leaves
pinnated, with eleven ovate lanceolate silky leaflets,
and is of a very rapid growth. We are not certain if
it will withstand our winters without protection.</p>

<p><i>Bign&ograve;nia cruc&iacute;gera</i>, is an evergreen which is very de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>sirable
in many situations, being likewise of luxuriant
growth. It will cover in a few years an area of fifty
feet; flowers of an orange scarlet colour, blooming from
May to August.</p>

<p><i>B. grandifl&ograve;ra</i>, now given to <i>Tecôma</i>, has large orange
coloured flowers, blooming from June to August, and
grows very fast. We are not positive that it will stand
our winters without protection.</p>

<p><i>B. r&aacute;dicans</i>, is likewise given to <i>Tec&ograve;ma</i>, and is a native
plant. When in flower it is highly ornamental, but
it requires great attention to keep it in regular order,
being of a strong rough nature; in bloom from June to
August.</p>

<p><i>Peripl&agrave;ca gr&aelig;ca</i>, is a climber of extraordinary growth.
Well established plants grow thirty or forty feet in one
season; flowers in clusters from May to July, of a brownish
yellow colour, and hairy inside; leaves smooth,
ovate, lanceolate, wood slender, twining, and elastic.</p>

<p><i>Hed&eacute;ra H&eacute;lix</i>, Irish Ivy, is a valuable evergreen for
covering naked walls, or any other unsightly object.
The foliage is of a lively green, leaves from three to
five angled. There are several varieties of it, all valuable
for growing in confined shady situations where no
other plant will thrive.</p>

<p><i>Ampel&oacute;psis heder&agrave;cea.</i> This plant is commonly employed
for covering walls, for which the rapidity of its
growth, and the largeness of the leaves, render it extremely
appropriate. There are several species of the
genus, all resembling the <i>Vine</i> in habit and in flower.</p>

<p>It is called by some <i>C&iacute;ssus heder&agrave;cea</i>, which is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
improper, this belonging to <i>Tetandria</i>, and the former to
<i>Pentandria</i>.</p>

<p>There are several other plants of a climbing habit,
both curious and ornamental; but our limits will not
admit of a detail.</p>


<h4>DECIDUOUS SHRUBS.</h4>

<p>Finish planting all deciduous shrubs in the early part
of the month. These plants are generally delayed too
long, the leaves in many instances are beginning to expand,
thereby giving a check to the ascending sap,
which we may safely assert causes the death of one
third of the plants, when perhaps the operator or some
individual more distantly concerned is blamed.</p>

<p>These shrubs, if properly removed and planted at
the exact starting of vegetation, pressing the earth
close to their roots when planting, (previously taking
care that the small fibres have not become dry by exposure,)
will not, by these simple attentions, one out of
fifty fail. Those that are late planted should have frequent
waterings, and if large, firmly supported, that the
wind may have no effect in disturbing the young and
tender fibrous roots.</p>


<h4>OF PLANTING EVERGREEN SHRUBS.</h4>

<p>Now is the season to plant all kinds of evergreen
trees and shrubs. In most seasons the middle of the
month is the most proper time, the weather then being
mild and moist; or if a late season, defer it to the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
of the month. When planted earlier, they will remain
dormant until this time, and their tender fibrous roots
in that case frequently perish from their liability to
injury from frost or frosty winds, being more susceptible
of such injury than fibres of deciduous plants. They
now begin to vegetate, which is the <i>grand criterion</i> for
transplanting any plant. The buds begin to swell, the
roots to push, and if they can be quickly lifted and replanted,
they will hardly receive a check. At all events
care must be taken that they are not long out of the
ground and exposed to the air, which greatly assists
the success in planting. It may be observed that evergreens
in general succeed the better the smaller they
are, although we have seen plants, trees, and evergreens,
successfully lifted upwards of thirteen feet high and
fifteen in diameter, and carried several miles. By the
second year there was no appearance that such operation
had taken place. In preparing a hole for the reception
of these plants, make it larger than the roots,
breaking the bottom thereof fine, and putting in some
fresh soil. Place the plant upright in the centre, putting
in the earth and breaking it fine, and give the plant
a few gentle shakes. When the roots are more than
half covered, put in a pot or pail full of water, allowing it
to subside, then cover all the roots, give a second or
third pail full, and when subsided the earth will be close
to all the roots. Cover with more earth, pressing all
firm with the foot. Put more soil loosely on, which
will give it a finished appearance, and prevent it from
becoming dry, and not requiring mulching, which has
an unsightly appearance. All that the wind will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
any hurtful effect upon, must be firmly supported, especially
large plants. If the weather sets in dry and hot,
they should be watered as often as necessity shall direct.</p>

<p>Those that are established, it will be necessary to
go over them (if not already done) to cut off all wood
killed in winter, and also to thin them if too thick and
crowded.</p>

<p>When the above is done, let every part of the shrubbery
be dressed off as directed in <i>March</i>. Shrubs of
all kinds will now begin to look gay and lively, which
may be very much heightened or depreciated, according
to the state in which the ground and contiguous
walks are kept. Always keep in view that weeds are
no objects of beauty.</p>


<h4>CARE OF CHOICE BULBS.</h4>

<p><i>Hyacinths</i> of the earliest sorts will begin to expand
and show their colours, of which we can boast of a
few as fine sorts in the vicinity of Philadelphia, as in
any garden of Europe; but even these very superior
sorts, when in bloom, are too frequently neglected,
being allowed to stand without rods, stakes, or any
means of support, likewise equally exposed to drenching
rains and scorching suns; and the finest collections
may be seen after heavy rains prostrate on the ground,
whereas a few hours' trouble would give them the requisite
support, thereby preserving their beauty much
longer, and giving more gratification. As soon as the
stems advance to any height, they should be supported by
wires, rods, &amp;c. and tied slightly thereto with threads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of matting, or any other substitute, repeat the tying as
they advance, avoid tying amongst the florets, because
they grow by extension, and are liable to be broken off
by so doing. The sun deteriorates the colours very
much, especially the red, blue, and yellow sorts; whereas
if they were simply protected from the sun by an
awning of thin canvass, the colours would be preserved
and the beauty protracted. If there are stakes drove
into the ground on each side of the beds, about three
feet high, with others in the centre about eight feet,
having laths or hoops from the side to the centre,
formed similar to the roof of a house, so that people
may walk or sit under it, the canvass or awning being
thin to admit of the light freely, the effect in the time of
sunshine from the brilliancy of the colours is peculiarly
gratifying. Where an awning is thus erected, it requires
to be kept on only from nine to three o'clock in
sunshine days, and during nights or time of rain, allowing
the awning on the most northern side to come
close to the ground when necessary, to shelter them
from cold cutting winds.</p>

<p><i>Tulips</i> in every respect should have the same care
and protection, never neglecting to have the beds with
a smooth clean surface, and the stems neatly tied up,
although they are not in so much danger as Hyacinths.</p>

<p>The properties of a good Hyacinth are, viz&mdash;the
stem strong and erect, the florets or bells occupying
one half of the stem, each floret suspended by a short
strong footstalk, longest at the bottom, the uppermost
floret quite erect, so that the whole may form a pyramid.
Each floret well filled with petals rising towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the centre, that it may appear to the eye a little convex.
Regarding colour, fancy does not agree, and the
scrupulous cultivators differ materially. However the
more pure and bright the finer, or a white with a pink
centre, or the centre of the petals with a paler or deeper
colour appearing striped, which is considered to have
a good effect.</p>

<p>Those of a good <i>Tulip</i> are&mdash;the stem strong, elastic,
and erect, about two feet high, the flower large and
composed of six petals, proceeding a little horizontally
at first, and then turning upwards, forming a flat-bottomed
cup, rather widest at the top; the three exterior
petals should be larger than the three interior ones,
and broader at their base; the edges of the petals entire,
free from notch or ruggedness; the top of each
well rounded; the colour of the flower at the bottom
of the cup ought to be pure, white, or yellow, and the
rich coloured stripes which are the principal ornament
should be pure, bold, regular, and distinct on the margin,
and terminate in fine points elegantly pencilled.
The centre of each petal should have one bold stripe,
or blotch of rich colouring. The ground colours that
are most esteemed are white, the purer the finer; or,
on the other hand, the dark grounds, and of course the
darker the better; but these vary in estimation, according
to the prevailing taste of amateurs.</p>


<h4>ANEMONES AND RANUNCULUS.</h4>

<p>Moist weather and frequent showers are highly essential
to the perfecting of these flowers, and if these
should fail at this season of the year, artificial means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
must be used to supply the deficiency. Take a watering-pot
without the rose, and run the water (river or
rain water is best) gently between the rows, taking
care not to make holes in the ground. When they
have got a good watering at root, take the syringe and
give them a gentle sprinkling in fine evenings, observing
not to use force for fear of breaking the flower
stems. In dry weather the result of a deficiency of
water would be that the stems and flowers of the
strongest roots will be weak, and make no progress,
and many of them will not bloom; the foliage of a
sickly, yellow appearance, from which they would not
recover; and the roots when taken up of little use for
farther transplanting.</p>

<p>A good plan in dry seasons is to cover the ground
between the rows with cow manure, which will prevent
the moisture from evaporating, and the rain or water
passing through it greatly enriches the soil, and
strengthens the roots.</p>


<h4>AURICULAS.</h4>

<p>Having under this head last month given ample directions
for the treatment of these plants previous to
flowering, we refer to that head to avoid repetition.</p>


<h4>CARNATIONS, PINKS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>If any of these were omitted to be shifted last month,
or planted out according to directions therein given, let
it be done forthwith. Where they are still protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
with frames, give them plenty of air, keeping the sashes
entirely off during the day, keep the pots perfectly free
from weeds, and give the foliage frequent sprinklings
with water.</p>

<p><i>Polyanthus</i> and <i>primroses</i> will be exhibiting their
beautiful flowers. They require the same treatment,
and delight in moisture and a shaded situation. Do
not sprinkle them while in flower, and keep them clear
of weeds or decayed leaves, never exposing them to the
sun. They are very hardy, and where required may be
planted in very shady situations, for they will suffer
more from the influence of the sun's rays than from
frost. Those plants in pots in general that have been
protected in frames, and are destined for the borders,
should now as soon as possible be planted in their destined
situations, having nothing to fear from chilling
winds or frosts after the middle of this month, except
in uncommon seasons. Those that are to be kept in
pots, if not repotted, do it immediately, and give regular
supplies of water.</p>


<h4>POLIANTHUS TUBEROSA FLORE PLENO.</h4>

<p>This very popular bulb, generally known as <i>Tuberose</i>,
has been cultivated in England upwards of two centuries,
whence we no doubt have received it, and now
can return those of our production to supply their demand.
The flowers are many and highly odoriferous,
and of the purest white, and on a flower stem from three
to five feet high. To have them in the greatest perfection,
they should be planted in a lively hot-bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
about the first of this month in six inch pots filled with
light rich earth, giving very little water until they begin
to grow, when they ought to be liberally supplied with
plenty of air, and about the end of next month they
may be planted in the borders, providing a spot for
them that is or has been well worked, and enriched
with well decomposed manure. Secure their flower
stems to proper rods. Previous to planting the roots,
all the off-sets should be taken off and planted separately;
keep the crown of the bulb level with the surface
of the pot, and when they are replanted in the open
ground, put them two inches deeper.</p>

<p>But when the convenience of a hot-bed cannot be
obtained, they will succeed very well if planted about
the end of this month or first of next in the garden, in a
bed of earth prepared for their reception. Let it be
dug deep, and make the soil light and rich, by giving it
a good supply of manure two years old, well broken
and incorporated with the earth, adding a little sand
where the soil is heavy. The black earth from the
woods produced from decayed leaves is equally as good
without sand. Having the ground in proper order,
draw drills about two and a half inches deep, and eighteen
inches apart; plant the bulbs (after divesting them
of their off-sets) nine inches apart in the row, covering
the crown of the bulb about an inch and a half.
When done, carefully rake and finish off the beds.
When they shoot up their flower stems, give them neat
rods for their support. Plant the off-sets in closer rows
to produce flowering roots for next year, because they
seldom flower the second time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>


<h4>AMARYLLIS FORMOSISSIMA, OR JACOBEA LILY.</h4>

<p>About the end of this or beginning of next month, is
the most proper time for planting out these bulbs.
This flower is of the most beautiful and rich crimson
velvet colour. The bulb generally produces two stems,
the one after the other, about the end of May or first
of June. The stem is from nine inches to one foot
high, surmounted by a single flower, composed of six
petals, three hanging down, three erect and recurved;
the stamens droop on the centre of the under petals.
The flower thus appears nodding on one side of the stem,
and has a most graceful and charming appearance.
If planted in a bed, prepare the ground as before directed
for <i>Tuberoses</i>. Keep the rows one foot asunder, and
the bulbs six inches apart in the rows, covering them
two inches over their crowns. This plant is now
called <i>Spreik&egrave;lia formos&iacute;ssima</i>, and we think properly
too, for its habit differs from <i>Amaryllis</i>.</p>

<p>We have not the smallest doubt that in a few years,
not only this superb South American bulb will adorn
our flower gardens, but many of the rich bulbs of Brazil
and South America generally will yearly exhibit to us
the beauty of their colours and the beautiful construction
of their flowers and foliage, of which we are now
generally deprived, perhaps because we have not the
conveniency of a proper hot-house for their protection
during winter. But it will be found, in many instances,
that these bulbs will do perfectly well to be kept dry in
a warm room from October to May, when the heat of
our summer is sufficient for the perfection of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
flowers, and many species will ripen their seeds. The
bulb that is known as <i>Amaryllis Bellad&oacute;nna</i>, now called
<i>Bellad&oacute;nna purpur&aacute;scens</i>, is hardy.</p>


<h4>TIGER FLOWER.</h4>

<p><i>Tigr&iacute;dia</i>, a genus of Mexican bulbs belonging to
<i>Monadelphia Tri&aacute;ndria</i>, and produce the most beautiful
flowers of the natural order of <i>Iride&aelig;</i>. <i>T. pav&ograve;nia</i> is
of the brightest scarlet, tinged and spotted with pure
yellow. <i>T. conchiifl&ograve;ra</i>, colour rich yellow, tinged and
spotted with bright crimson. The colours are very
rich, and purely contrasted. The corolla is about four
inches in diameter, composed of six petals; the outer
are reflexed, the flower of the largest, though splendid
in beauty, exists only one day; but to compensate for
that, a plant will produce flowers for several weeks;
and where a bed of them can be collected, they will
bloom in profusion from July to September. They
like a light rich free soil. Lift the bulbs in October,
and preserve them as directed in that month for <i>Tuberoses</i>.
Be sure that they be kept dry, and secure
from frost. A bed of these should be in every garden.
A writer says, "it is the most beautiful flower that is
cultivated." Plant them about the end of this or first
of next month; if in beds keep them one foot apart
each way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>


<h4>WALKS.</h4>

<p>The walks in general should be put in the neatest
order during this month. Little requires to be added
to the observations of last month, but if these have not
been executed, fail not to have it done the first opportunity,
choosing dry weather for the operation of <i>turning</i>
the old or adding new gravel to them, levelling, raking,
and rolling neatly as you proceed. Always after rain
give the whole of the gravel walks a good rolling.
This being frequently done during the early part of the
season, will be a saving of much labour and time
through the summer. The walks having a firm surface,
the growth of weeds will be retarded, and the heavy
rains will not be so apt to injure them. Where there
are any pretensions to keeping these in order, they
ought to be picked of weeds and litter once a week,
and gone over with the roller at least once every two
weeks during the season.</p>

<p>Sweep and divest the grass walks of all worm casts,
litter, &amp;c. cutting the edgings neatly. Mow the grass
every two weeks from this time to October, sweeping
off the grass clean each time, and give frequent rollings
to keep the surface smooth. If any require to be
laid with turf, delay it no longer. For directions see
last month. The above observations on walks in
general, will apply through the season; therefore we
will not repeat this subject until October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>


<h4>EVERGREEN HEDGES.</h4>

<p>We have previously observed, under the head of Evergreens,
that this is the best season for their replanting.
We cannot pass over the observations of this month,
without having reference to evergreen hedges, so much
neglected amongst us, and yet so important to the diversity
of aspect, and especially to soften a little the
gloomy appearance of our winters. There are three
indigenous shrubs, and at least one exotic, that are
well adapted for the purpose, viz, <i>P&igrave;nus canad&eacute;nsis</i>,
Hemlock-spruce; <i>Th&ugrave;ja occident&agrave;lis</i>, American arbor-vit&aelig;;
and <i>Jun&iacute;peris virgini&aacute;na</i>, Red cedar. These are
natives, and the two former are admirably adapted for
the purpose. Where there is to be a hedge of any of
these planted, select plants about two feet high; lift
them carefully, preserving the roots as much as possible.
Dig a trench from one and a half to two feet
wide, and from one to one foot and a half deep. This
will admit the soil about the roots to be well broken,
which must be done in planting. Keep the plants in
the centre of the trench, mixing the shortest and the
tallest, that it may be of one height, putting the earth
close about their roots as you proceed, and make it firm
with the foot; fill up, and water as directed for evergreens
in this month. If the season is very dry, give it
frequent copious waterings.</p>

<p>None of them should be topped for a few seasons,
except such as are much above the others in height,
keeping the sides regular and even by clipping or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
shearing once a year, either in this month or at the
end of August. It is better to keep the top (when they
have got to the desired height) pointed, than broad.
The latter method retains a heavy weight of snow,
which frequently breaks down, or otherwise deforms,
that which has cost much labour to put into shape.</p>


<h4>BOX EDGINGS.</h4>

<p>Where these have not been laid, this month is the
proper time. Do not delay the planting of such any
later. For ample directions see <i>March</i> under this head.
Clipping of those should be done about the middle of
this month. There will then be no danger of frosts to
brown the cut leaves, and the young foliage will not be
expanded. To keep these edgings in order, they must
be cut once a year, and never be allowed to get above
four inches high, and two inches wide. What we
consider the neatest edging is three inches high, two
inches wide at the bottom, tapering to a thin edge at
the top. It is very unsightly to see large bushy edgings,
especially to narrow walks.</p>

<p>The use of edgings is to keep the soil from the
gravel, and the larger they are allowed to grow the
more ineffectual they become; growing more open below
as they advance in height. The operation may be
done very expeditiously by clipping the tops level, going
longitudinally along with shears for the purpose, called
"box shears." Strain a line along the centre of the
edgings, cutting perpendicularly from the line to the
bottom on each side, leaving only the breadth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
line at top. Edgings, cut in this manner, every spring
will always look well, and the trouble, comparatively,
is a mere trifle.</p>


<h4>GRASS PLATS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>If these have not been laid down where wanted, delay
it no longer, for which see directions in <i>March</i>;
and where these are desired to be kept in order, they
should be mown every two or three weeks at farthest;
from this month to October when cut, the grass should
be clean swept off, and the edgings, if out of order, adjusted.
To mention this subject again will be only a
repetition, therefore we will let this suffice.</p>


<h4>GENERAL CARE OF PLANTS COMING INTO FLOWER.</h4>

<p>Every part of the flower ground should be put into
neat order, giving such plants about the borders as are
shooting up their flower stems, and are tender, and in
danger of being hurt or broken by the wind, proper
sticks or rods for their support. In doing this, endeavour
to conceal the rods, &amp;c. as much as possible, by
dressing the stems and leaves in a natural looking
manner over them. Let the stakes be in proportion to
the heighth and growth of the plants. It looks very
unsightly to see strong stakes to short and weak growing
plants. The tyings likewise should be proportionate.</p>

<p>Examine all the beds and patches of seedling flowers
now coming up, and let them be refreshed with water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
as it may be necessary, and pick out the weeds as they
appear.</p>

<p>We cannot leave this department at this season of
the year, without enforcing the benefit and beauty that
will result from keeping the weeds down during this
and next month. Therefore strictly observe that there
are none running to seed in any part of the garden; in
fact, they ought not to be allowed to rear their heads
above one day in sight.</p>

<h3><i>APRIL.</i></h3>


<p>We remarked last month, that about this season,
where it is convenient, an eastern window is more congenial
to plants than a southern. The sun becomes
too powerful, and the morning sun is preferable to that
of the afternoon. West is also preferable to south.
Some keep their plants in excellent order at a north
window. But the weather is so mild after this, that
there is no difficulty in protecting and growing plants
in rooms. They generally suffer most from want of air
and water; the window must be up a few inches, or altogether,
according to the mildness of the day. And
as plants are more liable to get covered with dust in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
rooms than in any other department, and not so convenient
to be syringed or otherwise cleaned, take the first
opportunity of a mild day to carry them to a shady situation,
and syringe such as are not in flower well with
water; or for want of a syringe take a watering-pot
with a rose upon it: allowing them to stand until they
drip, when they may be put into their respective situations.</p>


<h4>DIRECTIONS FOR PLANTS BROUGHT FROM THE GREEN-HOUSE.</h4>

<p>Any plants that are brought from the Green-house
during the spring months ought to be as little exposed
to the direct rays of the sun as possible. Keep them
in airy situations, with plenty of light, giving frequent
and liberal supplies of water. Plants may be often observed
through our city during this month fully exposed
in the outside of a south window, with the blaze of a
mid-day sun upon them, and these too just come
from the temperate and damp atmosphere of a well
regulated Green-house. Being thus placed in an arid
situation, scorched between the glass and the sun
whose heat is too powerful for them to withstand, the
transition being so sudden, that, however great their
beauties may have appeared, they in a few days become
brown, the flowers tarnished or decayed, and the failure
generally attributed to individuals not at all concerned.
From this and similar causes many have drawn the
unjust conclusion, viz. that "plants from Green-houses
are of too delicate a nature to be exposed in rooms or
windows at this early season." But every year gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
more and more proof to the contrary. There are ladies
in Philadelphia, and those not a few, whose rooms and
windows at this period vie with the finest of our Green-houses,
with respect to the health, beauty and order of
their plants, and we might almost say in variety. Some
of them have got above eight kinds of Camellias in
their collections, which afford a continual beauty
through the winter, with many other desirable and
equally valuable plants. Exposure to the sun, and
want of water, are the general cause of failures at this
period. We have spoken so minutely and so frequently
on these two subjects, that we think more repetition
unnecessary. The plants generally are growing pretty
freely by this time, and are not so liable to suffer from
liberal supplies of water, observing never to give it until
the soil in the pot is inclining to become dry, and
administering it always in the evenings.</p>


<h4>FLOWERING PLANTS.</h4>

<p>Our directions last month under this head will equally
apply now. The China <i>roses</i> that are now coming
plentifully in flower should be kept near the light, and
in airy exposures, to brighten their colours, otherwise
they will be very pale and sickly. <i>Geraniums</i> too ought
to have the like treatment.</p>


<h4>BRINGING PLANTS OUT OF THE CELLAR, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>All or most of the plants that have been in the cellar
during winter, such as <i>Pomegranates</i>, <i>Lagerstr&aelig;mias</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
<i>Hydr&aacute;ngeas</i>, <i>Oleanders</i>, <i>Sweet-bay</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> may be brought
out to the open air any time about the middle of the
month. If any of them stand in need of larger pots or
tubs, have them turned out, the balls reduced, and put
them in others a little larger; or where convenient they
may be planted in the ground, except <i>Oleanders</i>, which
do best to be a little confined. Be sure to keep the
<i>Hydr&aacute;ngeas</i> in shady situations. It will not be advisable
to expose entirely the Orange and Lemon trees,
until the end of this or first of next month. Where
there are any scale or foulness of any kind collected
on the foliage or wood, have them cleaned directly before
the heat increases the one, and to get clear of the
disagreeable appearance of the other.</p>

<h2><a name="Hot-House4" id="Hot-House4"><span class="antiqua">Hot-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>MAY.</i></h3>


<p>Very few directions for this department remain to be
given; except for shifting plants, and a few observations
on those that are most desirable for the Hot-house;
which we will do in this month, considering
May and June the best months of the year for that
operation.</p>

<p>The days and nights will be very mild by this time,
and the sashes in every favourable day should be opened
both in front and top, so that the plants may be
enured to the open air, which they will be exposed to
by the end of the month, Leave in the beginning of
the month the top sashes a little open every mild night,
and gradually as the heat increases leave the front
sashes and doors open. Continue to syringe them at
least every alternate night, and if possible every night;
and give them all, according to their respective wants,
liberal supplies of water every day. Absorption amongst
Hot-house plants is as great during this month as in
any period of the year.</p>


<h4>OF REPOTTING PLANTS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>It is our candid opinion that this and next month are
the best periods for shifting or repotting all or most of
Hot-house plants. The end of August being the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
always adopted around Philadelphia for that operation
(and then they are done indiscriminately,) we will assign
a few reasons for our practice.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, that it is not congenial to the nature of these
plants to have their roots surrounded with fresh soil,
when they are becoming inactive; <i>secondly</i>, that there
is not a sufficiency of heat naturally to quicken them to
an active state when they are encouraged; and <i>thirdly</i>,
being thus in new soil while dormant, they have a yellow
and sickly aspect until they begin to grow; and the
foliage thus deprived of its natural vigour will not appear
so healthful again. Whereas, if they are shifted
or repotted in this or next month, at which season they
are between two stages of growth, they immediately,
on receiving fresh assistance, and by the increasing
heat of the summer, make new growths, are perfectly
ripened before the approach of winter, and never lose
that verdureal appearance they have attained. These
are our reasons acquired from a close practice and observation,
and are not influenced by the doings of
others which are so much aside. No practical operator
especially, nor in fact any individual, ought to be
governed by custom in regard to the treatment of plants,
without having an idea as to why and wherefore,
founded on the principles of nature, and governed by
her unerring results.</p>

<p>As many are desirous of having a knowledge of plants,
before they order them, and likewise which are the
finest flowerers and their general character, especially
those who are at a great distance, and seldom have
the privilege of seeing what is most desirable, our de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>scriptions
will be limited, and simply such as are given
for the Green-house in March.</p>

<p><i>Ac&agrave;cias.</i> Several of these are desirable in the Hot-house,
for the grandeur of their foliage, beauty of
flower, and a few of them as specimens of valuable
medicinal plants. <i>A. Houst&oacute;ni</i>, now <i>Annesl&egrave;ia Houst&oacute;ni</i>, is
one of the most magnificent of the <i>Mim&ograve;sa</i> tribe, blooming
from August to November in large terminale spikes,
of a crimson colour, stamens very long, and beautiful;
leaves bipinnated in pairs. <i>A. grandifl&ograve;ra</i>, likewise given
to <i>Annesl&egrave;ia</i>, and similar to the former in colour;
has very large compound bipinnate leaves, with from
twenty to forty pairs. <i>A. Cat&egrave;chu</i>, flowers yellow, wood
spiny, leaves bipinnated, about ten pairs. The inner
wood of this tree is of a brown colour, from which the
<i>Cat&egrave;chu</i> used in medicine is prepared. It is disputed
whether <i>A. V&eacute;ra</i>, or <i>A. Ar&aacute;bica</i> produces the gum Arabic.
We are inclined to think it is the latter, which
grows principally on the Atlas mountains. The gum
exudes spontaneously from the bark of the tree in a
soft half fluid state. There are many others of this
genus belonging to the Hot-house, but being shy in
flowering, are not generally esteemed. Most of the
flowers have the appearance of yellow balls of down,
and are hermaphrodite. The pots should all be well
drained.</p>

<p><i>Aloe.</i> These grotesque looking succulent plants
are principally natives of the Cape of Good Hope, and
consequently will do well in the warmest part of the
Green-house, although when convenient, they frequently
get a situation in the Hot-house. It is not requisite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
except for <i>A. vulg&agrave;ris</i>, known as <i>A. barbad&eacute;nsis</i>; which
has orange yellow flowers; <i>A. obl&iacute;qua</i>, now called <i>Gast&egrave;ria
obl&iacute;qua</i>; <i>A. dich&oacute;toma</i>; and <i>A. line&agrave;ta</i>, which is perhaps
the finest of the genus. The leaves are beautifully
striped, with red spines, flowers scarlet and green.
These are the only ones that actually need heat during
winter. They ought to have very little water, once a
month is sufficient. They would grow without it, and
several of them would also grow by being suspended
in the house, without earth or any substitute about
their roots, by being frequently sprinkled with water.</p>

<p>Few of them are admired for the beauty of their
flowers, but the whole are considered curious. They
flower from May to September.</p>

<p><i>Ard&iacute;sias</i>, about eighteen species. Plants highly esteemed
for the beauty of their foliage, flowers, and
berries. The most popular in our collections is <i>A.
crenul&agrave;ta</i>. It has rose coloured star-like flowers, in terminale
panicles, and produces beautiful small red berries,
which continue until other berries are produced
the following year, and frequently there may be seen
on one plant, the berries of three successive years, thus
being a very ornamental plant and very desirable. It is
vulgarly called the Dwarf ever-bearing cherry. It will
keep in a good Green-house, but not grow freely. <i>A. solan&agrave;cea</i>
has large oblong leaves, narrowed at each end,
and bears purple berries; <i>A. &eacute;legans</i> has entire, oblong,
shining leaves; <i>A. umbell&agrave;ta</i>, once <i>A. littor&agrave;lis</i>, is the
finest of the genus for abundance of flower and beauty
of foliage. The flowers are pink, in large decompound
panicles, the leaves the largest of all the species, oblong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
wedge shaped, nearly sessile, entire, smooth, and reflexed.
They are all evergreens, and the pots should
be well drained. They are natives of the East Indies,
and delight in a high temperature.</p>

<p><i>Aristolochias</i>, Birth-wort. There are several of these
belonging to the Hot-house, but none of them deserving
particular observation, except <i>A. labiosa</i>. The
leaves are reniform, roundish, cordate, and amplexicaule;
the flower or corolla is of a curious construction,
being incurved, and at the base swelled or saccate
with a large lip, and all beautifully spotted; colour
greenish brown. It is a climbing plant, and requires a
strong heat.</p>

<p><i>Astrap&oelig;as</i>, three species. <i>A. Wallichii</i> is a celebrated
plant in Europe, and a few specimens of it are in this
country. It has scarlet unbellated flowers, with an
involucre, has twenty-five stamens united into a tube,
bearing the corolla with five petals; leaves roundish,
cordate, accuminate, very large with persistent, ovate
wavy stipules. The plant is of easy culture, and grows
freely, wood very strong.</p>

<p><i>Areca</i>, Cabbage-tree, ten species. They are a kind
of palms, with large pinnated leaves, or properly fronds.
In their indigenous state they are from six to forty feet
high, but in the Hot-house they seldom exceed twenty
feet. <i>A. catechu</i> is used in medicine. <i>A. oler&aacute;cea</i> is
cultivated extensively in the West Indies, and the tender
part of the top is eaten by the natives. <i>A. montana</i>
is most frequent in collections. There is no particular
beauty in the flowers. They are all easily grown, if
plenty of heat be given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Brunsvigias</i> are all large bulbs from the Cape of
Good Hope, and will keep in the Green-house during
winter, but are better where they can obtain a situation
in the Hot-house. It is a splendid genus, containing
about ten species. Some of the bulbs grow to an
enormous size, and all of them while growing require
a liberal supply of water; but when dormant it must be
wholly withheld, and they should have large pots to
make them grow and flower in perfection. <i>B. multiflora</i>,
flowers scarlet and green; the leaves lay on the
surface of the pot. <i>B. lat&igrave;coma</i>, flowers pale purple.
<i>B. Josephin&aelig;</i> has splendid rose coloured flowers, and
is the most admired species of the genus: the foliage
spreading, half erect, and glacous; flowers numerous,
and in large umbels, on a stem two feet high, blooming
successively; there is a variety that has striped
flowers.</p>

<p>Several other species have been given to different
genera. <i>B. falcata</i> is now <i>Ammocharis falcata</i>; <i>B. marginata</i>,
now <i>Imhofia</i>; and <i>B. cilliaris</i>, is now <i>Buphone
cilliaris</i>. They all flower in umbels, on stems from six
inches to two feet; flowers lily-like with six petals.</p>

<p><i>Bambusa</i>, Bamboo-cane, two species. Plants of
very strong growth, and are used in the East Indies,
where they are indigenous, for every purpose in the
construction of huts, for furniture both domestic and
rural, for fences, boats, boxes, paper, &amp;c. It is frequently
used as pipes to convey water. The species thus
useful, is <i>B. arundinacea</i>, which grows to a great height.
We do not mention it as interesting in beauty, but as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
valuable plant, for the many useful purposes to which
it is applied. It requires to be kept wet.</p>

<p><i>Banist&egrave;rias</i>, a genus of about fourteen climbing evergreen
plants. Three of them are esteemed. <i>B. f&uacute;lgens</i>,
yellow flowers in racemose spikes, leaves subovate, and
downy beneath. <i>B. Chrisophylla</i> has beautiful foliage, as
if covered with a shining gold coloured dust; leaves
large, oblong, acute. <i>B. spl&egrave;ndens</i>, flowers in spikes of
a yellow colour; foliage large and silvery like; the pots
should be well drained.</p>

<p><i>Barringt&ograve;nias</i>, two species. <i>B. speci&ograve;sa</i> has produced
a great excitement amongst cultivators, and is one of
the handsomest plants produced within the tropics.
The leaves are large, oblong, acute, shining, with
fleshy nerves, tinged with red; the flowers are large,
full of stamens with four petals, opens in the evening
and fades at sunrise; colour purple and white; grows
freely in strong heat.</p>

<p><i>Brôwneas</i>, five species of splendid plants, but scarce
in collections. <i>B. cocc&iacute;nea</i> has scarlet flowers in pendulous
bunches, corolla semi-double, foliage bipinnate,
in three pairs. <i>B. r&ograve;sa</i>, mountain rose of Trinidad.
<i>B. grandic&eacute;ps</i> is the finest of the genus, leaves bipinnated;
leaflets cordate, accuminate, downy and pendulous,
flowers rose colour, in large close heads. Drain
the pots well.</p>

<p><i>Calath&egrave;a zebr&igrave;na</i>, frequently known as <i>Mar&aacute;nta zebr&igrave;na</i>,
and now <i>Phrynum zebr&igrave;num</i>, is a plant unique in its appearance.
The large elongated ovate leaves are beautifully
striped with green and dark purple, and called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
<i>Zebra plant</i>. It has light blue flowers in ovate spikes,
about the size of large pine cones. It is a herbaceous
plant; but in the warmest part of the Hot-house retains
its splendid foliage; requires a very liberal supply
of water, and ought to be in every collection.</p>

<p><i>C&aacute;nnas</i>, about thirty species, several of them deserving
cultivation both for flower and foliage; they are
principally natives of the West Indies, and might all be
easily obtained. The finest are <i>C. gig&aacute;ntea</i>, has large
leaves and orange flowers; <i>C. limb&agrave;ta</i>, flowers scarlet and
yellow; <i>C. d&iacute;scolor</i>, has large cordate, accuminate leaves
of a crimson colour, the flowers are scarlet; <i>C. iridifl&ograve;ra</i>,
has large crimson nodding flowers, very different from
any of the others, and the finest of the genus. They
all, while in a growing state, require a liberal supply of
water; and being herbaceous plants watering ought to
be given up about the first of November, and renewed
about the first of January, thus giving them a cessation
which they require to flower freely; but when water is
constantly given, which is the general plan in our collections,
they continue to push weak shoots and few
flowers.</p>

<p><i>C&aacute;ctus.</i> This extensive genus is curious, grotesque,
interesting, and varied in character and habit; is now
divided into six distinct genera according to their natural
appearance and habit. We will describe a few
of each genus, none of which going under the name of
<i>C&aacute;ctus</i>, we will give them the six following.</p>

<p><i>Mamill&agrave;rias</i>, above twenty species, and are those
which are covered with roundish bearded tubercles,
and with small red and white flowers. <i>M. cocc&iacute;nea</i>; <i>M.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
<i>simplex</i>; <i>M. pus&iacute;lla</i>, and <i>M. c&ograve;nica</i>, are good species,
and will do well with water five or six times during
summer.</p>

<p><i>Meloc&aacute;ctus</i>, seven species, and are those that are
roundish with deep and many angles, with spines in
clusters on the top of the angle. <i>M. comm&ugrave;nis</i>, is the
Turk's cap, named from having an ovate conate crown
upon the top, from which proceed the small red flowers.</p>

<p><i>M. macr&aacute;nthus</i>, has large spines; <i>M. pyramid&agrave;lis</i>, is a
conical growing species. These require the same
treatment as the last.</p>

<p><i>Echinoc&aacute;ctus</i>, about twenty species; are those that
have many deep angles, and have a remarkable swelling,
with each parcel of spines; <i>E. gibb&ograve;sus</i>; <i>E. crisp&agrave;tus</i>;
<i>E. rec&uacute;rvus</i>; are curious in appearance, with small
white and purple flowers. These three genera in most
collections are not well known specifically, but it is
easy to discriminate which genus they are connected
with.</p>

<p><i>C&egrave;reus.</i> This is the most magnificent genus with
regard to the magnitude and beauty of the flowers, but
not so closely allied. It takes in all those of a trailing
or erect growing habit, having spines in clusters, solitary,
or spineless. <i>C. peruvi&agrave;nus</i> and <i>C. heptag&ograve;nus</i>,
grow very erect, and to the height of thirty or forty feet
in Peru and Mexico, where they plant them close together
as fences, and they are in a few years impenetrable.
<i>C. flagellif&oacute;rmus</i> is a well known creeping free
flowering species, has ten angles; will keep in a good
Green-house, and produce in May and June a great
number of blooms. The petals are of a fine pink and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
red colour; the tube of the flower is long, and will
stand a few days in perfection, when others come out
successively for the space of two months, and during
their continuance make a brilliant appearance. <i>C.
grandifl&ograve;rus</i> is the celebrated "Night-blooming Cereus."
The flowers are very large, beautiful, and sweet-scented.
They begin to open about sun-down, and are
fully expanded about eleven o'clock. The corolla, or
rather calyx, is from seven to ten inches in diameter, the
outside of which is a brown, and the inside a fine straw
yellow colour; the petals are of the purest white, with
the stamens surrounding the stile in the centre of the
flower, which add to its lustre, and make it appear like
a bright star. Its scent is agreeable, and perfumes
the air to a considerable distance; but these beauties
are of momentary duration. By sunrise they fade, and
hang down quite decayed, and never open again.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> One
of these ought to be in every collection, and if trained
up a naked wall will not occupy much room, and grow
and flower profusely. They need very little water. C.
<i>specios&iacute;ssimus</i> has most beautiful large flowers, about six
inches diameter; the outside petals are a bright scarlet,
those of the inside a fine light purple. One flower
lasts a few days, and a large plant will produce every
year from ten to twenty flowers, blooming from May
to August. It has flowered in some of our collections,
and is highly esteemed. <i>C. triangul&agrave;ris</i> has the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
flower of the <i>Cacte&aelig;</i> family; the bloom is of a cream
colour, and about one foot in diameter. In its indigenous
state, it produces a fine fruit called "Strawberry
Pear," and is much esteemed in the West Indies as
being slightly acid, and at the same time sweet, pleasant,
and cooling. It seldom flowers. C. <i>phyllantho&iacute;des</i>,
once <i>C&aacute;ctus speci&oacute;sus</i>, is one of the most profuse in
flowering; the branches are ensate, compressed, and
obovate, without spines; flowers of a pink colour, about
four inches in diameter; the stamens as long as the
corolla, with white anthers. It will keep well in a
Green-house or Room. If in either of the two latter,
give water only a few times during winter. This is
becoming a very popular plant. C. <i>Jenkins&ograve;ni</i> is a
magnificent hybrid from C. <i>specios&iacute;ssimus</i>. The flowers
are equally as large, and of a brilliant scarlet colour,
with a profusion of pure white anthers; is greatly admired,
and is only in a few collections. C. <i>Ackerm&aacute;nni</i>
is very similar to C. <i>phyllantho&iacute;des</i>, flowering equally as
profusely, the colour a bright scarlet, and the scarcest
species of the genus that is worthy of notice. C.
<i>trunc&agrave;tus</i>, branches truncated, flowers deep scarlet and
tubular, from two to three inches in diameter; the stamens
protrude from the corolla; the plant is of a dwarf
growth and branched; when in flower it is quite a picture.
It is said that there are free and shy flowering
varieties of this species, but we doubt it; perhaps it is
owing to the cultivation and soil.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> They may be preserved if cut off when in perfection, and put in spirits of
wine, in a chrystal vase, made air tight. A plant flowered in our collection in
May 1830, at 12 o'clock at noon&mdash;the only instance of the kind we ever heard
of.</p></div>

<p><i>Op&uacute;ntias</i>, about forty species, and are those whose
branches are in joints flatly oblong, or ovate, spines
solitary, or in clusters. The plants are not so desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
for beauty of flower as the species of the former genus,
but many of them are remarkable for their strong grotesque
and spiny appearance; besides several of the species
are extensively cultivated for the Cochineal insect.
The one most valued for that purpose, is <i>O. cochin&iacute;llifera</i>,
which has only small clusters of bristles upon the oblong
ovate joints, and produces small red flowers; C.
<i>ficus &iacute;ndica</i>, is also used, but is very spiny.</p>

<p><i>Per&eacute;skias.</i> About four species, and those that are of
a shrubby nature producing leaves; <i>P. acule&agrave;ta</i> bears
a fruit called "Barbadoes-gooseberry." The flowers
are very small and simple, spines about half an inch
long, leaves fleshy and elliptical.</p>

<p>The whole of the plants in the family of <i>Cacte&aelig;</i> require
very little water, and delight in a dry warm situation.
They do not agree with frequent repotting; once
in two or three years to young plants, and in five or six
to those that are established, with the exception of the
large, free flowering species, which should be repotted
once in two years.</p>

<p><i>Coff&egrave;a Ar&aacute;bica.</i> It produces the celebrated coffee, and
is a plant universally known in our collections, and of
easy culture. The leaves are opposite, oblong, wavy
and shining, the flowers white, of a grateful odour, but
of short duration. There is a plant known as C. <i>occidentalis</i>,
which is now <i>Tetram&egrave;rium odorat&iacute;ssimum</i>. It
requires a great heat to grow well, therefore should
be kept in the warmest part of the Hot-house. The
flowers are white, in panicles, and larger than the common
jasmine, and is very sweet-scented; leaves oblong,
lanceolate, accuminate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Callic&aacute;rpas.</i> About twelve species, and are generally
admitted into collections, though of no particular interest
or beauty, except in the bright purple berries they
produce, which is rarely. The foliage is of a rugose,
hoary appearance.</p>

<p><i>Carol&iacute;neas.</i> About six species of tender plants, with
large digitate leaves, and of handsome growth. The
flowers have numerous filaments, and are large and
singular. C. <i>ins&iacute;gnis</i> has the largest and compactest
blossoms; C. <i>&agrave;lba</i> is the only one of the genus that has
white flowers, all the others being red; C. <i>pr&iacute;nceps</i> and
C. <i>rob&uacute;sta</i> are noble looking species, and are much esteemed.
They require a good heat, with which they
will grow freely.</p>

<p><i>Cary&ograve;tas.</i> A genus of palms. C. <i>&ugrave;rens</i> is an admired
species, produces flowers in long pendulous spikes,
which are succeeded by strings of succulent globular
berries. In its native state it produces a sweet liquor
in large quantities, and no stronger than water.</p>

<p><i>Coccol&ograve;bas</i>, Sea-side grape. This genus is admired
for its beautiful large foliage, which is oblong ovate,
and cordate ovate; C. <i>pub&eacute;scens</i> and C. <i>latif&ograve;lia</i> are
the finest species. They bear berries in clusters like
the grape, but never come to perfection in artificial
cultivation.</p>

<p><i>C&ugrave;phea Melv&iacute;lla</i>, is the only species of the genus that
is particularly deserving of a situation, has lanceolate
scabrous leaves, narrowed at each end, flowers tubular
in a terminale whorl, colour scarlet and green. The
plant must be well drained. It will flower from May to
September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cr&ograve;tons.</i> About twenty-eight species, few of them
deserving cultivation; but the genus is celebrated for its
beautiful C. <i>p&igrave;ctus</i>, leaves oblong-lanceolate, variegated
with yellow, and stained with red, flowers small green,
on axillary spikes. C. <i>variag&agrave;tus</i>, variety <i>latif&ograve;lia</i>, is
finer than the original <i>variag&agrave;tus</i>, the nerves in the
leaves are yellow, and the leaves lanceolate, entire and
smooth. To make them grow freely, give the warmest
part of the Hot-house, and drain the pots well.</p>

<p><i>C&eacute;rberas.</i> About twelve species of strong growing
trees, full of poisonous juice. C. <i>thev&egrave;tia</i> is an elegant
plant, with accumulate leaves, and large, nodding, yellow,
solitary, fragrant flowers, proceeding from the
axil; C. <i>aho&ugrave;ai</i> produces a nut which is deadly poison.
C. <i>od&agrave;llam</i>, once C. <i>m&agrave;nghas</i>, has large star-like flowers,
white, shaded with red. They are principally East
India plants, and require great heat.</p>

<p><i>Cycas</i>, four species, generally called <i>Sago palm</i>, as
an English name. The plant that <i>Sago</i> is extracted
from, belongs to another genus, (see <i>S&agrave;gus</i>.) C. <i>revol&ugrave;ta</i>
is a well known palm, and will keep perfectly well
in the Green-house. We have seen a beautiful specimen
of it which is kept every winter in the cellar, but
those that are kept so cool in winter only grow every
alternate year, while those that are kept in the Hot-house
grow every year, which shows that heat is their
element. C. <i>circin&agrave;lis</i> is a large growing species; the
fronds are much longer, but not so close and thick. C.
<i>gla&ugrave;ca</i> is a fine species; the foliage is slightly glaucous.
They require plenty of pot room, are much infested
with the small white scaly insect, and ought to be fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>quently
examined and carefully washed as prescribed
in January.</p>

<p><i>Combr&egrave;tums.</i> Nine species of beautiful flowering
climbing plants, standing in very high estimation. The
leaves of the principal part of them are ovate, acute,
flowers small but on large branches, the flowers all
coming out on one side of the branch. They have a
magnificent effect. <i>C. &egrave;legans</i>, red; <i>C. form&ograve;sum</i>, red and
yellow; <i>C. pulch&eacute;llum</i>, scarlet; <i>C. com&ograve;sum</i> has crimson
flowers in tufts; <i>C. purp&ugrave;reum</i> is the most splendid of
the genus. It was first cultivated in 1818, and so much
admired, that the whole of the species as soon as introduced,
was extravagantly bought up, and none of
them has retained their character, except <i>C. purp&ugrave;reum</i>,
which is now called <i>Po&iacute;vrea cocc&iacute;nea</i>. The flowers are
bright scarlet, in large branches, blooming profusely
from April to September, and flower best in a pot.
When planted in the ground it grows too much to
wood, carrying few flowers. This plant ought to be
in every Hot-house.</p>

<p><i>Cr&agrave;ssula.</i> This genus has no plants in it attractive
in beauty. Several beautiful plants in our collections
belong to <i>R&ograve;chea</i> and <i>Kalos&aacute;nthus</i>. There is a strong
growing succulent plant, known in our collections as
<i>C. falc&agrave;ta</i>, which is <i>R. falc&agrave;ta</i>. It seldom flowers; the
minor variety blooms profusely every year from May to
August, and has showy scarlet flowers in terminale
panicles. The plants known as <i>C. cocc&iacute;nea</i> and <i>C. vers&iacute;color</i>
are now given to the genus <i>Kalos&aacute;nthus</i>. The
flowers of the former are like scarlet wax, terminale
and sessile; <i>K. odorat&iacute;ssima</i> has yellow terminale sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>-scented
flowers. They require very little water, only
a few times in winter, and about twice a week in summer;
they are all desirable plants.</p>

<p><i>C&oacute;ryphas</i>, (Large fan Palm,) five species of the most
noble and magnificent of palms. <i>C. ambracul&iacute;fera</i>, the
fronds or leaves are palmate; in Ceylon, where the
tree is indigenous, they are frequently found fifteen
feet wide and twenty feet long. Knox says they will
cover from fifteen to twenty men, and when dried will
fold up in the shape of a rod, and can be easily carried
about, and serve to protect them from the scorching
sun. <i>C. tali&egrave;ra</i>, now <i>Tali&egrave;ra bengal&eacute;nsis</i>, being stronger,
is of great utility for covering houses. They do not
grow to such immense extent in artificial cultivation,
but require large houses to grow them.</p>

<p><i>Cr&igrave;nums</i>, about one hundred species, chiefly stove
bulbs, many of them beautiful. Those that are of
great celebrity are <i>C. cru&eacute;ntum</i>, colour red; <i>C. sc&agrave;brum</i>,
crimson and white; <i>C. am&agrave;bile</i>, purple and white; the
neck of the bulb of the latter is long and easily distinguished
from its purplish colour, and is considered the
finest of the genus. Several specimens of it are in
our collections. Their flowers are in umbels, on a
stalk from one to three feet high; corolla funnel shaped;
petals recurved. They require large pots to make
them flower well, and when growing to be liberally
supplied with water.</p>

<p><i>Cyrt&agrave;nthus</i>, a genus of Cape bulbs, containing nine
species, and will do very well in the Green-house, but
we find the assistance of the Hot-house a great advantage.
They are closely allied to <i>Cr&igrave;num</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
tubes of the flowers are long and round, with various
shades of orange, yellow, red, and green. <i>C. od&ograve;rus</i>,
<i>C. stri&aacute;tus</i>, <i>C. obl&iacute;quus</i>, and <i>C. vitt&agrave;tus</i>, are the finest.
When the bulbs are dormant, which will be from October
to January, they should not get any water; before
they begin to grow, turn the bulb out of the old
earth, repotting it immediately. At this time they
should be potted with the balls of earth entire, which
will cause them to flower stronger.</p>

<p><i>Caryophyllus arom&aacute;ticus</i>, is the only species, and the
tree that produces cloves. The whole plant is aromatic,
and closely allied to <i>Myrtus</i>; the flowers are in
loose panicles, the leaves oblong, accuminate, entire.
It is a fine evergreen. Pots must be well drained.</p>

<p><i>Dill&egrave;nias</i>, three species of fine plants, with beautiful
foliage. <i>D. speci&ograve;sa</i> has produced considerable excitement
in our collections. The leaves are elliptic,
oblong, simply serrated, nerves deep; the flower is
white, with five bold petals, centre filled with barren
anthers; it has not been known to flower in America.
<i>D. sc&aacute;ndens</i> has ovate, simply serrated leaves, but is not
known as to flower; it is a fine climber.</p>

<p><i>Drac&aelig;nas</i>, Dragon-tree, about twelve species of Asiatic
plants, varied in character. <i>D. f&eacute;rrea</i> is plentiful in
our collections, and will keep in the Green-house; but
the foliage is not so well retained as when kept in the
Hot-house; the leaves are lanceolate, acute, of a dark
purple colour. <i>D. fr&agrave;grans</i>, when in bloom, will scent
the air for a considerable distance, leaves green and
lanceolate. <i>D. margin&agrave;ta</i> is rare, yet it is to be seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
a few of our collections. <i>D. str&iacute;cta</i> is now <i>Charlw&ograve;odia</i><a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
<i>str&iacute;cta</i>, flowers blush and in loose panicles. <i>D. Dr&aacute;co</i>
is admired, and the most conspicuous of the genus.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> In honour of Mr. Charlwood, an extensive seedsman of London, who has
made several botanical excursions on this continent.</p></div>

<p><i>Er&aacute;nthemums</i>, about ten species. <i>E. pulch&eacute;llum</i> and
<i>E. b&iacute;color</i> are the finest of the genus; the former is in
our collections, but miserably treated. The soil in
which it is grown is too stiff and loamy, and it seldom
gets enough of heat. The latter is indispensable to
make it flower in perfection; therefore it should have
the warmest part of the house, and it will produce
flowers of a fine blue colour from January to September.
The flowers of the latter are white and dark purple,
with a few brown spots in the white; blooms from
April to August. Drain the pots well, and give the
plants little sun during summer.</p>

<p><i>Eug&egrave;nias</i>, about thirty species, esteemed for their
handsome evergreen foliage. This genus once contained
a few celebrated species, which have been divided.
(See <i>Jamb&ograve;sa</i>.) The Allspice tree, known as
<i>Myrtus Pim&eacute;nta</i>, is now <i>E. Pim&eacute;nta</i>; the leaves are
ovate, lanceolate, and when broken have an agreeable
scent. There are several varieties all of the same
spicy fragrance. The plant is in very few of our collections.
<i>E. fr&agrave;grans</i> is sweet scented; the flowers are
on axillary peduncles; leaves ovate, obtuse.</p>

<p><i>Euph&oacute;rbia</i> (spurg), a genus of plants disseminated
over every quarter of the globe; a few are beautiful,
many grotesque, and several the most worthless weeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
on the earth. There are about two hundred species, and
from all of them, when probed, a thick milky fluid exudes.
Those of the tropics are the most curious, and
very similar in appearance to <i>C&aacute;ctus</i>, but easily detected
by the above perforation. There is a magnificent
species in our collections, which was lately introduced
from Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> It goes under the name of <i>E. heterophylla</i>.
The flowers of the whole genus are apetalous,
and the beauty is in the bracte&aelig;; of the species alluded
to the bracte&aelig; is bright crimson, very persistent, and
above six inches in diameter, when well grown. The
plant requires a strong heat, or the foliage will become
yellow and fall off. We question whether this species is
nondescript or as above. It is a brilliant ornament to the
Hot-house three fourths of the year, and always during
winter, and should have a situation in every tropical
collection.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> By Poinsett the American Consul for Mexico in 1828.</p></div>

<p><i>Erythr&igrave;nas</i> (Coral tree), a genus containing about
thirty species of leguminose, scarlet-flowering plants.
Several species are greatly esteemed for their beauty
and profusion of flowers, which in well established
plants are produced in long spikes at the end of the
stems and branches. <i>E. Corallod&eacute;ndrum</i> blooms magnificently
in the West Indies, but in our collections has
never flowered. Perhaps if it was kept dry during its
dormant season, which is from November to January,
and when growing greatly encouraged, it might produce
flowers. <i>E. speci&ograve;sa</i> is a splendid flowerer, leaves
large, ternated, and prickly beneath; stem prickly. <i>E.
pub&eacute;scens</i> is valued for its large peculiar brown pubescent
leaves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>
<p>In regard to <i>E. herb&agrave;cea</i>, which is a native of the Carolinas,
and frequently treated as a Hot-house plant, it is
our opinion that it would be more perfectly grown if
planted about the first of this month in the garden; and
when growing, if well supplied with water, it would
flower from July to September. About the first of November
lift the roots and preserve them in half dry earth,
in the same place with the <i>D&aacute;hlias</i>. <i>E. laurif&ograve;lia</i> and <i>E.
cr&iacute;sta-g&aacute;lli</i> are likewise often treated as Hot-house plants,
and in such situations they cast prematurely their first
flowers, by the confined state of the air. They will keep
in perfect preservation during winter in a dry cellar, half
covered with earth, or entirely covered with half dry
earth; consequently, the best and easiest method of
treatment, is to plant them in the garden about the
first of May, and when growing, if the ground becomes
dry, give them frequent waterings. They will flower
profusely three or four times in the course of summer.</p>

<p>We freely recommend the last species to all our patrons,
confident that it will give ample satisfaction, both
in profusion of flower and beauty of colour. The soil
they are to be planted into should be according to
that prescribed in the list; or if they are kept in pots,
they must be enlarged three or four times, when they
are in a growing state, to make them flower perfectly;
otherwise they will be diminutive.</p>

<p><i>F&igrave;cus</i>, Fig-tree, a genus containing above fifty Hot-house
species, besides several that belong to the Green-house;
greatly admired for the beauty of their foliage.
A few of them are deciduous, and all of the easiest culture.
We have seen plants of <i>F. el&aacute;stica</i> hung in the
back of the Hot-house, without the smallest particle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
earth, their only support being sprinklings of water
every day. <i>F. Br&aacute;ssii</i> is the finest looking species that
has come under our observation; the leaves are very
large, shining, cordate, accuminate; nerves strong and
white. As the beauty of these plants is entirely in the
foliage and habit, we will select the best of them in the
list to which we refer.</p>

<p><i>G&aelig;rtn&egrave;ra racem&ograve;sa</i>, is a large climbing woody shrub,
with pinnated leaves, leaflets ovate, lanceolate, flowers
white, five petaled, beautifully fringed; blooms in dense
panicles. When the plants are allowed to climb, they
do not flower freely; but if closely cut in, they will
flower every year in great profusion, after the plants
are well established. It is now called <i>Hipt&agrave;ge Madabl&ograve;ta</i>.</p>

<p><i>Geissom&egrave;ria longifl&ograve;ra.</i> This is a new genus, and
closely allied to <i>Ru&eacute;llia</i>. The species alluded to, is a
free flowerer, blooming from May to August, in close
spikes of a scarlet colour; leaves opposite, ovate, elongate,
and shining; the plants must be well drained, and
in summer kept from the direct influence of the sun.</p>

<p><i>Gard&egrave;nias</i>, a genus containing about seventeen species,
several of them very popular in our collections,
going under the name of <i>Cape Jasmine</i>, which do well
in the Green-house, (see <i>May</i>.) The species requiring
this department, and deserving attention, are <i>G. campanul&agrave;ta</i>,
of a soft woody nature, with ovate, accuminate
leaves; flowers of a straw colour, and solitary; <i>G.
am&oelig;na</i>, the flowers are white, tinged with crimson, terminale
and solitary; <i>G. cost&agrave;ta</i>, admired for its beautiful
ribbed foliage, <i>G. l&ugrave;cida</i> has a handsome, ovate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
accuminate, shining foliage; flowers white and solitary.
They require to have the pots well drained.</p>

<p><i>Heriti&egrave;ra litt&oacute;ralis</i>, Looking-glass plant. This plant
is unisexual, has beautiful large, ovate, veiny leaves;
the flowers are small, red, with male and female on the
same plant, but different flowers. It requires a strong
heat, and plenty of pot room. How the English name
becomes applicable to it, we are not acquainted.</p>

<p><i>Hib&iacute;scus.</i> This genus affords many fine species and
varieties of plants for the Hot-house, besides others
for every department of the garden. The most popular
in our collections for the Hot-house, is <i>H. R&ograve;sa sin&eacute;nsis</i>,
with its varieties, which are magnificent, and
flower profusely, from April to September. The single
or original species is seldom seen in cultivation; the
varieties are <i>H. R&ograve;sa sin&eacute;nsis r&ugrave;bro pl&eacute;nus</i>, double red;
<i>H. R. S. c&aacute;rnea pl&egrave;nus</i>, double salmon; <i>H. R. S.
varieg&agrave;tus</i>, double striped; <i>H. R. S. fl&aacute;vo-pl&egrave;nus</i>, double
buff; <i>H. R. S. l&ugrave;tea pl&egrave;nus</i>, double yellow, or rather
sulphur. The plants grow freely, and produce their
flowers three or four inches of diameter, from the
young wood; the leaves are ovate, accuminate, smooth,
entire at the base and coarsely toothed at the end. All
the varieties are of the same character, and highly deserving
of a situation in every collection. There is
said to be a double white variety, which we doubt;
it is not in artificial cultivation. <i>H. mut&agrave;bilis fl&ograve;re pl&egrave;no</i>
is a splendid plant of strong growth, and will, when well
established, flower abundantly, if the wood of last year
is cut to within a few eyes of the wood of the previous
year; the flowers are produced on the young wood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
come out a pale colour, and change to bright red, and
about the size of a garden Provins rose; leaves downy,
cordate, angular, five-lobed, accuminate, and slightly
toothed. <i>H. lilliifl&ograve;rus</i>, is a new highly esteemed species;
the flowers are various in colour, being pink,
blush, red, purple, and striped. We have not seen it
in flower, but had its character verbally, from a respectable
cultivator. The leaves vary in character,
but are generally cordate, crenate, accuminate; the
petioles are brown, and the whole slightly hirsute; is
deciduous, and requires to be kept in the warmest part
of the house.</p>

<p><i>H&oacute;yas</i>, Wax-plant, seven species. All of them are
climbing succulents, requiring plenty of heat and little
water. <i>H. carn&ograve;sa</i> is the finest flowering species of the
genus, and known in our collections as the wax plant;
the leaves are green and fleshy; the flowers are mellifluous,
five parted, and in pendulous bunches, slightly
bearded, and have every appearance of a composition
of the finest wax; of a blush colour. <i>H. crassif&ograve;lia</i> has
the best looking foliage, and the flowers are white.
The former will keep in the Green-house, but will not
flower so profusely.</p>

<p><i>Hern&aacute;ndias</i>, Jack-in-a-box. The species are rare,
except <i>H. son&ograve;ra</i>, which is an elegant looking plant,
when well grown; the leaves are peltate, cordate, accuminate,
smooth; flowers white, and in panicles; the
fruit a nut. The English name is said to have been
given, in allusion to the small flowers and large leaves
of the plant. A great heat is required to grow it
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ipom&aelig;as</i>, a genus of tropical climbing plants, nearly
allied to <i>Convolv&uacute;lus</i>, but of greater beauty. <i>I. panicul&agrave;ta</i>
has large purple flowers in panicles, with large
palmated smooth leaves. <i>I. J&aacute;lapa</i> is the true jalap of
the druggists, but not worthy of any other remark. <i>I.
grandifl&ograve;ra</i>, large white flowers, with acute petals; leaves
large, cordate, ovate. <i>I. pulch&eacute;lla</i> has flowers of a handsome
violet colour. They are all easily cultivated. It
is said that <i>I. tuber&ograve;sa</i> is much used in the West Indies
to cover arbours, and will grow three hundred feet in
one season; the flowers are purple striped with yellow,
leaves palmated. We are not certain but the roots of
this kind may be kept like the sweet potato, and become
a useful ornament to our gardens.</p>

<p><i>Ix&ograve;ras</i>, a genus of fine flowering plants, and does extremely
well in our collections in comparison to the
state they are grown in England. The genus specifically
is much confused amongst us, either from error
originating with those who packed them for this country,
or after they have arrived. <i>I. purp&ugrave;rea</i>, leaves oblong,
ovate, blunt; flowers crimson; it is now called
<i>I. obav&agrave;ta</i>. <i>I. croc&agrave;ta</i>, leaves oval, lanceolate, narrowing
towards the stem, smooth, underside of the leaf the
nerves are very perceptible; flowers saffron coloured.
<i>I. r&ograve;sea</i>, leaves large, regular, oblong, a little acute,
very distant on the wood, centre nerve strong; flowers
rose coloured in large corymbs, branching: <i>I. Bandh&ugrave;ca</i>,
leaves very close to the stem, ovate, accuminate;
nerves straight, middle nerve stronger than any other of
the genus; flowers scarlet, corymbs crowded. <i>I. Bl&aacute;nda</i>,
leaves small, lanceolate, ovate; flowers blush, cymes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
branching in three. <i>I. dichot&igrave;ma</i>, leaves largest of the
genus, ovate, accuminate, undulate, footstalk 3/8 of an inch
long; whereas none of the leaves of the other species has
footstalks of any length. It is now called <i>I. undul&agrave;ta</i>,
flowers are white. <i>I. grandifl&ograve;ra</i>, leaves ovate, elongate,
sessile; flowers in crowded corymbs, and scarlet; is
called, <i>I. cocc&iacute;nea</i> in the Botanical Magazine, by which it
is known in our collections, and is the same as <i>I. str&iacute;cta</i>.
<i>I. fl&aacute;mmea</i> and <i>I. speci&ograve;sa</i>, leaves oblong, subsessile;
flowers scarlet, in round spreading dense corymbs.
<i>I. f&uacute;lgens</i>, same as <i>I. longif&ograve;lia</i> and <i>I. lanceol&agrave;ta</i>; foliage
glossy; flowers scarlet. <i>I. Pav&eacute;tta</i>, the flowers are white,
and said to be sweet-scented, the leaves of all the species
are opposite; there are a few other species that we are
not thoroughly acquainted with, but have been thus explicit
to prevent error as far as possible in this beautiful
genus. They are all evergreen, low growing shrubs;
the plants grow best in Jersey black sandy earth, but
flower most abundantly with half loam.</p>

<p><i>Jacar&aacute;ndas</i>, a genus of beautiful shrubs, containing
five species, with <i>Bignônia</i>-like blue or purple flowers.
<i>I. mim&ograve;sifolia</i> and <i>I. filicif&ograve;lia</i> are the finest. The former
has blue, and the latter purple flowers; in loose
branching panicles. They are evergreen, and easy of
culture.</p>

<p><i>Jamb&ograve;sas</i>, about twelve species, which have been principally
taken from <i>Eug&egrave;nia</i>, and contain its finest plants,
and is a splendid genus of evergreen shrubs. <i>E. J&aacute;mbos</i>
is now <i>Jamb&ograve;sa vulg&agrave;ris</i>, which flowers and fruits freely in
our Hot-houses. The fruit is about an inch in diameter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
eatable, and smelling like a rose, hence called "Rose
Apple." The petals of all the species are simple, and
may rather be considered the calyx; the beauty of the
flowers is in the many erect spreading stamens, either
straw, white, rose, or green colour. <i>J. malacc&eacute;nsis</i>,
Malay Apple, is greatly esteemed for the delightful fragrance
of its fruit. We frequently see <i>J. purpur&aacute;scens</i>,
which is a native of the West Indies, going under <i>J. m.</i>
which is an Asiatic species, with white flowers and entire
oblong leaves; whereas the leaves of <i>J. p.</i> are small,
ovate, accuminate, young shoots and leaves purple. <i>J.
macrophylla</i>, white, and <i>J. amplexica&ugrave;lis</i>, green, have very
large oblong, lanceolate leaves, and is of a strong woody
habit. They are all easy of culture.</p>

<p><i>Jasm&igrave;num</i>, Jasmine, is a favourite genus of shrubs, for
the exquisite fragrance of its flowers, of which none are
more delightful than <i>J. S&agrave;mbac</i> or Arabian Jasmine.
There are two other varieties of it, <i>J. S. m&uacute;ltiplex</i>, semi-double;
and <i>J. S. trif&ograve;liatum</i>, Double Tuscan Jasmine.
The latter requires a great heat to make it grow and
flower freely. We suspect there is another variety in
cultivation. <i>J. hirs&ugrave;tum</i> has cordate downy leaves;
flowers many, in terminale, sessile umbels. <i>J. panicul&agrave;tum</i>,
white, flowering in terminale panicles from March
to November; leaves smooth, oval, obtusely accuminate;
<i>plant scarce</i>. <i>J. simplicif&ograve;lium</i> is in our collections under
the name of <i>J. lucidum</i>; plant spreading; leaves oblong
and shining. There are several other species, all with
white flowers, and generally easy of culture.</p>

<p><i>J&aacute;tropha</i>, Physic-nut, is a genus of six strong growing
shrubs, natives of the West Indies. <i>J. multifida</i> and <i>I.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
<i>pandur&aelig;f&ograve;lia</i> have the handsomest foliage, and both
have scarlet flowers; the appearance of the foliage of
this genus is the only object; the flowers are small, in
coarse disfigured panicles, and several of the species
have not been known to flower in artificial cultivation.
The seeds of <i>J. c&uacute;rcas</i> are often received from the West
Indies; the leaves are cordate, angular, and smooth. <i>J.
manihot</i>, now <i>Manihot cannab&igrave;na</i>, is the Cassada root,
the juice of which, when expressed, is a strong poison.
They are all easy of culture: want of strong heat in
winter will make them cast their leaves, but do them
no other injury.</p>

<p><i>Just&iacute;cia.</i> A few species of this genus are fine showy
hot-house plants. <i>J. cocc&iacute;nea</i> has large terminale spikes
of scarlet flowers, blooming from December to March,
and a very desirable plant, of easy culture, and should
be in every collection; it is apt to grow spindly, if not
kept near the glass. <i>I. picta</i>, with its varieties; <i>I. l&uacute;cida</i>
and <i>I. form&oacute;sa</i>, are fine shrubby species. <i>I. speci&ograve;sa</i>
is a beautiful purple flowering herbaceous plant.</p>

<p><i>K&aelig;mpf&egrave;ria</i>, an Asiatic genus of tuberose rooted
plants; none of them in our collections, except <i>K. rot&uacute;nda</i>;
the flowers come up a few inches above the pot,
without the leaves, in April and May and frequently
sooner; they are purple and light blue, partially streaked
and spotted; leaves large, oblong, purplish coloured
beneath. The roots when dormant ought to be kept
in the pot without watering, otherwise they will not
flower freely. No bulbs or strong tuberose rooted plants,
will flower in perfection if kept moist when they are
not growing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lant&agrave;na</i>, a genus of twenty species, all free flowering
shrubs; the flowers are small, in round heads blooming
from the axils, in yellow, orange, pink, white, and changeable
colours; the plants are of such a rough straggling
growth, that they are not esteemed. There are
four or five species in our collections. They will not bear
a strong fumigation; therefore, when the Hot-house is
under that operation, they must be set down in the
pathway, or other low part in the house.</p>

<p><i>Lat&agrave;nias.</i> This genus contains three species of
handsome palms. <i>L. borb&ograve;nica</i> is one of the finest of
the <i>Palm&aelig;</i>, not growing to great magnitude; the leaves
or fronds are plaited flabelliform, leaflets smooth at
the edge, footstalk spiny, and the plant spreading. <i>L.
r&ugrave;bra</i>, fronds same as the former, but leaflets more
divided and serrulate; footstalk unarmed; foliage reddish.
<i>L. glaucophylla</i>, same as <i>L. r&ugrave;bra</i>, only the foliage
glaucous. They are all valuable plants, and are obtained
by seed from the East Indies. They require
plenty of pot room.</p>

<p><i>La&uacute;rus.</i> This genus, though of no beauty in flower,
is generally admired in collections for its fine evergreen
foliage, and aromatic or spicy flavour, and several
trees are important in medicine. The most esteemed
are given to a genus named <i>Cinnam&ograve;mum</i>, as has been
observed in the Green-house, (see <i>March</i>.) <i>L. Chlor&oacute;xylon</i>
is the Cogwood of Jamaica. <i>L. P&eacute;rsea</i> is now
<i>P&eacute;rsea grat&iacute;ssima</i>, Alligator-pear, a fruit about the size
of a large pear, and greatly esteemed in the West
Indies. The plant is generally known in our collections.
<i>C. v&eacute;rum</i> is the true Cinnamon of commerce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>The part taken is the inside of the bark when the tree
is from five to eighteen years old. The leaves are
three-nerved, ovate, oblong; nerves vanishing towards
the point, bright green above, pale beneath, with whitish
veins. This plant ought to be kept in the warmest
part of the Hot-house. C. <i>c&aacute;ssia</i>, is frequently given
under the former name, but when compared may be
easily detected by the leaves being more lanceolate,
and a little pubescent. They both make handsome
plants, but require great heat. Drain the pots well of
the delicate sorts.</p>

<p><i>Magn&iacute;fera</i>, Mango tree. There are two species.
<i>M. &iacute;ndica</i> is in our collections, and bears a fruit which
is so highly esteemed in the East Indies, as to be considered
preferable to any other except very fine pine
apples. The leaves are lanceolate, and from six to
eight inches long, and two or more broad. The
flowers are produced in loose bunches at the end of
the branches, but of no beauty, and have to be artificially
impregnated, or it will scarcely produce fruit.
The shell is kidney-shaped, and of a leathery, crustaceous
substance. They contain one seed, and in their
indigenous state are more juicy than an apple. Drain
the pots well, as the roots are apt to get sodden from
moisture. The other species goes under the name of
<i>oppositif&ograve;lia</i>, but we question if it is not only a variety,
for it has every character of the one just described.</p>

<p><i>Mel&agrave;stoma</i>, was once an extensive genus, on which
the natural order <i>Melastomace&aelig;</i> is founded; but is now
much divided into other genera contained in the natural
tribe <i>Micome&aelig;</i>. There are about thirteen species re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>maining
in the genus. They now display great unity
of character, and many of them may be considered
very ornamental. The finest are <i>M. malab&aacute;thrica</i>,
rose-coloured; <i>M. sangu&iacute;nea</i>, lilac; <i>M. dec&eacute;mfida</i>,
purple; <i>M. pulverul&eacute;nta</i>, red; and <i>M. &aacute;spera</i>, rose.
There is a plant in several of our collections known
as <i>M. purp&ugrave;rea</i> and <i>M. tetrag&ograve;na</i>, which is <i>Oss&aelig;a purpur&aacute;scens</i>;
leaves ovate, lanceolate, accuminate, five-nerved,
pilose; the footstalk and nerves underside of
the leaf covered with brown hairs; stem four-sided;
flowers purple. All the species are easy of culture.
<i>M. nepal&eacute;nsis</i> is a Green-house plant.</p>

<p><i>Malp&iacute;ghia</i>, (Barbadoes-cherry,) about eighteen species,
all beautiful evergreen trees or shrubs. They
are easily distinguished by having bristles on the under
side of the leaves. These bristles are fixed by the
centre, so that either end of it will sting. We are not
aware of any other plant being defended in the manner.
<i>M. &ugrave;rens</i> has oblong ovate leaves with decumbent
stiff bristles; flowers pink. <i>M. aquif&ograve;lia</i> has lanceolate,
stiff, spiny leaves, and we think the most
beautiful foliage of the genus. <i>M. fuc&agrave;ta</i> has elliptical
shining leaves, with lilac flowers. <i>M. gl&aacute;bra</i>, leaves
ovate, entire, smooth; flowers purple. They all have
five rounded clawed petals. The last species is cultivated
in the West Indies for its fruit. The pots must
be well drained.</p>

<p><i>M&aacute;rica</i>, a genus of Hot-house plants, closely allied
to Iris, between which there is no distinction in the
leaves. The flowers of <i>M. c&aelig;r&ugrave;lea</i> are beautifully spotted
with light and dark blue, the scape many flowered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
M. <i>Sab&igrave;ni</i> has flowers similar, but not so dark in colour.
M. <i>Northi&agrave;na</i> has splendid white and brown spotted
flowers, spathe two flowered. These plants when
growing require a liberal supply of water, and to be
greatly encouraged by frequent potting to flower well.</p>

<p><i>M&ugrave;sa</i> (Plantain-tree), contains eight species, and is
greatly esteemed in the East and West Indies for the
luscious sweet flavour of its fruit, which can be converted
into every delicacy in the domestic cookery of the
country. M. <i>paradis&igrave;&aelig;a</i> is the true plantain tree, has a
soft herbaceous stalk, 15 or 20 feet high, with leaves
from 5 to 7 feet long, and about 2 feet wide. M. <i>sapi&eacute;ntum</i>
is the true Banana-tree; habit and character
same as the former, except it has a spotted stem, and
the male flowers are deciduous. The pulp of the fruit
is softer, and the taste more luscious. M. <i>ros&agrave;cea</i>, M.
<i>cocc&iacute;nea</i>, and M. <i>chin&egrave;nsis</i>, are most esteemed in artificial
cultivation for their flowers, and being smaller in
growth. They all require a very liberal supply of water
when growing. They do best to be planted in the
soil, where there can be a small corner of the Hot-house
set apart for the purpose. They will be ornamental,
but if kept in pots they will never attain any
degree of perfection.</p>

<p><i>Nep&eacute;nthes</i> (Pitcher plant). There are two species
of this plant. <i>N. distillat&ograve;ria</i> is an esteemed and valuable
plant in European collections. The leaves are
lanceolate and sessile; from their extremity there is a
spiral, attached to which are lublar inflated appendages
that are generally filled with water, which appears to
be confined within them by a lid, with which the ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>pendages
are surmounted; hence the name of pitcher
plant. We have never observed these lids close again
when once open. Writers have called it a herbaceous
plant, but it is properly a shrub, never dying to the
ground, having a continuation of extension. The pot
in which it grows should be covered with moss, and the
roots liberally supplied with water every day. It delights
to be in a marshy state. The flowers are small
and in long spikes.</p>

<p><i>Pancr&agrave;tium</i> is a genus of Hot-house bulbs, and now
only contains five species. They are all free-flowering.
Several of them are handsome and fragrant. P. <i>Mar&iacute;timum</i>
and P. <i>verec&uacute;ndum</i> are the finest; the flowers
are white, in large umbels; petals long, recurved, and
undulate. P. <i>littor&agrave;lis</i>, P. <i>speci&ograve;sum</i>, and P. <i>carib&aelig;um</i>,
are now given to the genus <i>Hymenoc&aacute;llis</i>, and are fine
flowering species. Care must be taken not to give
them much water while dormant. The soil ought at
that time to be in a half dry state. They are in flower
from May to August.</p>

<p><i>Polysp&ograve;ra axill&agrave;ris</i>, once called <i>Cam&eacute;llia axill&agrave;ris</i>,
though in appearance it has no characteristic of a
<i>Cam&eacute;llia</i>, and has been frequently killed in the Green-house
by being too cold for its nature; leaves oblong,
obovate, towards the extremity serrulate. The leaves
on the young wood are entire. Flowers white; petals
a little notched. It is worthy of a situation in every
collection.</p>

<p><i>Passifl&ograve;ra</i>, "Passion-Flower, so named on account
of its being supposed to represent in the appendages
of its flower the Passion of Jesus Christ." There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
about fifty species, all climbing plants, that belong to
the Hot-house. Many are of no ordinary beauty; a
few species are odoriferous; others bear edible fruits,
though not rich in flavour. P. <i>al&agrave;ta</i> is in our collections,
and greatly admired; the flowers are red, blue, and white,
beautifully contrasted, and flower profusely in pots. P.
<i>racem&ograve;sa</i>, has red flowers, and one of the most profuse
in flowering. P. <i>c&aelig;r&ugrave;leo-racem&ograve;sa</i>, purple and red,
and by many thought to be the finest of the genus. P.
<i>quadrangul&agrave;ris</i> has beautiful red and white flowers.
The plant is in several collections, but has seldom
flowered; it requires to be planted in the ground to
make it flower freely, and it will also produce fruit. P.
<i>filament&ograve;sa</i> is white and blue, and a good flowerer. P.
<i>pictur&agrave;ta</i> is a scarce and beautiful variously coloured
species. There are many other fine species, but these
are the most esteemed sorts; and when well established
will flower profusely from May to August. They
are desirable in every collection, and will take only a
small space to hold them, by training the vines up the
rafters of the Hot-house.</p>

<p><i>Pand&agrave;nus</i>, Screw Pine. There are above twenty
species in this genus, several of them very interesting,
but none so greatly admired as P. <i>odorat&iacute;ssimus</i>. The
leaves in established plants are from four to six feet
long, on the back and edges spiny; are spreading, imbricated,
and embracing the stem, and placed in three
spiral rows upon it. The top soon becomes heavy
when the plant throws out prongs one, two, or three
feet up the stem in an oblique descending direction,
which take root in the ground, and thus become per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>fectly
supported. It is cultivated in Japan for its delightful
fragrance, and it is said, "of all the perfumes,
it is by far the richest and most powerful." P. <i>&ugrave;tilis</i>,
red spined. We question this species, and are inclined
to believe that it is the former, only when the plants
are newly raised from seed, the spines and leaves are
red, changing to green as they become advanced in
age. The plants are easy of culture, and will grow
almost in any soil.</p>

<p><i>Pterosp&eacute;rmum</i>, five species of plants that have very
curiously constructed flowers, of a white colour, and
fragrant; the foliage is of a brown rusty nature, and
before expansion silvery-like. P. <i>suberif&ograve;lium</i> is in several
of our collections, and esteemed. P. <i>semisagitt&agrave;tum</i>
has fringed bract&aelig;a; leaves oblong, accuminate, entire,
sagittate on one side.</p>

<p><i>Plum&egrave;rias</i>, above twenty species. Plants of a slow
growth, robust nature, and are deciduous. The foliage
is greatly admired. The plants are shy to flower,
but are brilliant in colour. P. <i>acumin&agrave;ta</i>, has lanceolate,
acute leaves; flowers corymbose and terminale.
P. <i>tr&iacute;color</i> has oblong, acute, veiny leaves; corolla red,
yellow, and white. This and P. <i>r&ugrave;bra</i> are the finest of
the genus. They ought not to get any water while
not in a growing state.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>, Date-palm, about eight species, principally
Asiatic plants. The foliage is not so attractive as
many others of the palm family, but it is rendered interesting
by producing a well known fruit called Date.
P. <i>dactyl&iacute;fera</i> will do very well in a common Green-house.
In Arabia, Upper Egypt, and Barbary, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
much used in domestic economy. P. <i>palud&oacute;sa</i> has the
most beautiful foliage, and the best habit. The flowers
are di&oelig;cious.</p>

<p><i>Rosc&ograve;ea.</i> A genus of about five species, all pretty,
but not much known. <i>R. purp&ugrave;rea</i> has been introduced
into our collections, and is the finest of the genus.
The flowers are light purple, large, and in terminale
sheaths at the top of the stem. <i>R. spic&agrave;ta</i> and <i>R. capit&agrave;ta</i>
are both fine species, with blue flowers. They are
all herbaceous, with strong half tuberous roots, requiring
little water while dormant, and a liberal supply
when growing.</p>

<p><i>Ru&eacute;llia.</i> There are a few species, very pretty free
flowering plants, of easy culture. <i>R. form&ograve;sa</i>, flowers
long, of a fine scarlet colour; plant half shrubby. <i>R.
fulg&iacute;da</i> has bright scarlet flowers on axillary long stalked
fascicles. <i>R. persicif&ograve;lia</i>, with unequal leaves, and
light blue flowers, is now called <i>R. anisophylla</i>; and
the true one has oblong, wavy, leaves, deeply nerved,
petioles long; flowers yellow, sessile, in axillary
and terminale heads, stem erect. One healthy plant
will be frequently in flower from January to June.
This species ought to be in every collection, both for
its beauty of flower and foliage.</p>

<p><i>Rh&aacute;pis</i>, a genus of palms, that will grow very freely
with heat, and room at the roots. <i>R. flabellif&oacute;rmis</i> is
an erect growing palm, with a spreading head. It is a
native of China.</p>

<p><i>Thunb&eacute;rgia</i>, a genus containing six climbing plants,
of a half shrubby nature. Some of them have a fragrant
odour. <i>T. cocc&iacute;nea</i>, red; <i>T. grandifl&ograve;ra</i>, blue; <i>T.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
<i>fr&agrave;grans</i>, sweet-scented; <i>T. al&agrave;ta</i>, has pretty buff and
purple flowers, which are in great profusion. We are
not certain but the latter will make a beautiful annual
in the Flower-garden. It seeds freely, and from the
time of sowing until flowering is about two months, if
the heat is brisk. If sown in May, they will bloom from
July until killed by frost.</p>

<p><i>S&agrave;gus</i>, Sago-palm. We are of opinion that the true
palm from which the sago of the shops is produced,
has not been introduced into our collections. It is
very rare in the most extensive collections of Europe,
but is not so fine as the one we have under the Sago,
which is placed in the natural order of <i>Cycade&aelig;</i>; and
Sagus is in that of <i>Palm&aelig;</i>. The finest of this genus
is <i>S. vin&iacute;fera</i> and <i>S. R&uacute;mphii</i>. They grow to a great
height; even in artificial cultivation they may be seen
from ten to twenty-five feet. We have not introduced
them here for their beauty, but to prevent error.</p>

<p><i>Sol&aacute;ndra</i>, a genus of four species, remarkable for the
extraordinary size of their flowers, and are considered
beautiful. <i>S. grandifl&ograve;ra</i> and <i>S. viridifl&ograve;ra</i> are the two best.
The plants will bloom best if they are restricted in pot
room, and are only introduced as being worthy of cultivation.
If they are repotted once in two or three
years, it is sufficient, except where the plants are small
and want encouragement.</p>

<p><i>Stroph&aacute;nthus</i>, a small genus of beautiful tropical
shrubs. The segments of the corolla are curiously
twisted before expansion. <i>S. div&eacute;rgens</i> is a neat spreading
shrub, with yellow flowers, a little tinged with red;
the petals are about four inches long, undulate, lanceo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>late.
<i>S. dich&oacute;tomus</i> is rose coloured, corolla funnel
shaped. The plants will flower freely in a strong
moist heat. Drain the pots well.</p>

<p><i>Swiet&egrave;nia</i> (mahogany-tree), the wood of which is celebrated
in cabinet-work. <i>S. Mah&oacute;goni</i>, common. This
tree varies much in general appearance according to
soil and situation. The leaves are pinnated in four
pairs; leaflets ovate, lanceolate; flowers small, white,
in axillary panicles. <i>S. fubrif&ugrave;ga</i>, leaves pinnated, in
four pairs; leaflets elliptical; flowers white, in terminale
panicles. The wood of the last is the most durable
of any in the East Indies. They are fine plants, and
require heat and pot room to produce flowers.</p>

<p><i>Tec&ograve;ma</i>, a genus of plants closely allied to <i>Bign&ograve;nia</i>,
and are free-flowering; several of them much esteemed.
<i>T. m&oacute;llis</i>, <i>T. digit&agrave;ta</i>, and <i>T. spl&egrave;ndida</i>, are the most
beautiful of those that belong to the Hot-house. They
have large orange coloured, tubular, inflated, ringent
flowers, in loose panicles. There is a plant known in
our collections as <i>Bign&ograve;nia st&aacute;ns</i>, which is now <i>T. st&agrave;ns</i>;
has pinnated leaves, with oblong, lanceolate, serrated,
leaflets; flowers in simple terminale, raceme, and of
a yellow colour, and sometimes known by Ash-leaved
<i>Bign&ograve;nia</i>. It will always have a sickly aspect, if not
well encouraged in light rich soil. Drain the pots well,
as much moisture disfigures the foliage.</p>

<p><i>Tabern&aelig;mont&aacute;na</i>, a genus of little beauty, except for
one or two species. A plant known in some collections
as <i>N&egrave;rium coron&agrave;rium</i>, is now, and properly, <i>T. coron&agrave;ria</i>.
The variety, <i>fl&ograve;re pl&egrave;no</i>, is the one most deserving
of culture, and will flower profusely from May to August;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the flowers are double white, fragrant, and divaricating.
The plant will lose its foliage if not kept in a strong
heat; therefore place it in the warmest part of the Hot-house.
<i>T. densifl&ograve;ra</i> is a fine species, but very rare.
Drain all the plants well, and keep them in the shade
during summer.</p>

<p><i>Thrinax parvifl&ograve;ra</i>, is a fine dwarf palm of the West
Indies, with palmated fronds, plaited with stiff, lanceolate
segments. The plant is of easy cultivation, and
will grow in any soil.</p>

<p><i>Z&agrave;mia</i>, a genus of plants in the natural order of <i>Cycade&aelig;</i>.
Several species of them are admired. <i>Z. m&eacute;dia</i>,
<i>Z. furfur&agrave;cea</i>, <i>Z. t&eacute;nuis</i>, <i>Z. integrif&ograve;lia</i>, are the most
showy that belong to the Hot-house. The whole genus
is frequently kept in this department. They are all
plants of a slow growth, and the beauty is entirely in
the pinnated fronds, with from ten to forty pairs of leaflets.
The pots must be well drained.</p>

<p>Those genera of plants which we have enumerated
under the head of repotting in this or next month, are
composed of the finest Hot-house plants that have
come under our observation. There are perhaps a
few of them that are not to be found in the United
States, or even on our continent; but the great object,
in a choice collection of plants, is to have the finest
from all parts of the known world. There are many
plants whose nature does not require much support
from soil, which is frequently observed in those that are
mentioned. And there are many hundreds of plants desirable
for beauty, ornament, and curiosity, which are
not specified, our limits not permitting such an extend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>ed
detail. Those whose nature agrees better with repotting
at other periods, shall be noticed, especially
those that are in the collections of the country. We
have previously observed, that plants ought not to be
flooded with water when newly potted, as it saturates
the soil before the roots have taken hold of it; and
that the best draining for pots is small gravel or potshreds
broken fine. We wish it to be understood that
when plants are repotted, any irregular branch or shoot
should be lopped off, that cannot be tied in to advantage.
And repotting may take place either before or
after the plants are exposed to the open air, according
to convenience.</p>


<h4>OF BRINGING OUT THE HOT-HOUSE PLANTS.</h4>

<p>Where the Hot-house is very crowded with plants,
the best method to have them exposed without danger
is, to take out those of the hardiest nature first, that
have no tender shoots upon them, thereby thinning the
house gradually. This may be done from the 16th to
the 20th of the month, which will admit of a free circulation
of air amongst those that remain. All may
be exposed from the 24th to the 28th of the month.
This is a general rule, though in some seasons there
maybe exceptions. Having previously given all the
air possible to the house, that no sudden transition
take place, which would make the foliage brown, and
otherwise materially injure the plants, choose calm
days for the removing of them.</p>

<p>There are few plants while in pots that agree with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the full sun upon them; or if the plants receive the sun,
the pots and roots ought not. The best situation for
them is on the north side of a fence, wall, house, or
other building, where they are excluded from the mid-day
sun, and they should stand on boards or gravel,
with the tallest at the back, firmly, tied to a rail or some
other security, to prevent them from being overturned
by high winds. A stage erected, where it is practicable,
for the reception of the smaller plants, and they
set thinly and regularly thereon, is preferable to crowding
them with the taller sorts. And it may be desired
to have some of the plants plunged in the garden
through the flower borders. Of those that are so
treated, the pots must be plunged to the brim, and regularly
turned round every two weeks, to prevent the
roots from running into the earth. If the roots were
allowed to do so, it might for the present strengthen
the plant, but ultimately would prove injurious.</p>

<p>Where a sufficiency of shade cannot be obtained, it
would be advisable to go to the expense of a very thin
awning, that would not exclude the light, but merely
the powerful rays of the sun, attending to roll it up
every evening. Plants will keep in beautiful order by
the above method, which amply repays for the trouble
or expense. Avoid putting plants under trees; comparatively
few thrive in such situations.</p>

<p>When they are thus all exposed to the open air, it
will be very little trouble to give them a gentle syringing
every evening when there is no rain, and continue
your usual examinations for insects: when they appear
resort to the prescribed remedies. <i>Green-fly</i> will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
affect them, but perhaps the thrips. Give regular supplies
of water to their roots every evening, and some
will require it in the morning, especially small pots.</p>


<h4>SUCCULENTS.</h4>

<p>These plants are habituated to exposed dry, hot,
situations in their indigenous state; and an aspect,
where they would have the full influence of the sun,
is the best, giving them water two or three times a
week.</p>

<h2><a name="Green-House4" id="Green-House4"><span class="antiqua">Green-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>MAY.</i></h3>


<p>About the first of the month, all the small half hardy
plants may be taken out of the green house, and those
that are left will be more benefited by a freer circulation
of air, which will enure them to exposure. The
<i>Geraniums</i> ought to stand perfectly clear of other plants,
while in flower and growing, or they will be much drawn
and spindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>


<h4>WATERING.</h4>

<p>We have advanced so much on this subject, another
observation is not necessary; except as to succulents,
which are frequently overwatered about this period.
Before they begin to grow, once a week is sufficient.</p>


<h4>OF BRINGING OUT THE GREEN-HOUSE PLANTS.</h4>

<p>Those trees or plants of <i>Orange</i>, <i>Lemon</i>, <i>Myrtle</i>, <i>Nerium</i>,
&amp;c. that were headed down with the intention of
planting them into the garden, to renovate their growth,
should be brought out and planted in the situations intended
for them. A good light rich soil will do for either,
and the balls of earth might be a little reduced, that
when they are lifted they might go into the same pot
or tub, or perhaps a less one. This being done, the
plants, generally in a calm day from the 12th to the 18th
of the month, should be taken out, carrying them directly
to a situation shaded from the sun, and protected
from the wind. In regard to a situation best adapted
for them during summer, see <i>Hot-house</i> this month, which
will equally apply to Green-house plants, except <i>D&aacute;phne
od&ograve;ra</i>, <i>D&aacute;phne hybrida</i>, and the Green-house species
of <i>Coron&iacute;lla</i>, which must be shaded from every ray
of the sun, and even from dry parching winds. All
Primroses and Polyanthus delight in shade. The reason
of so many plants of the <i>D. od&ograve;ra</i><a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> dying is from the
effects of the sun and water.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> On examining these plants, when the first appearance of decay affected them,
the decayed part was without exception at the surface of the soil, which was completely
mortified, while the top and roots were apparently fresh. This led us to
conclude that the cause was the effect of sun and water on the stem. We have
since kept the earth in a conical form round the stem, thereby throwing the water
to the sides of the pot, and kept them in the shade. Previous to doing this, we
had quantities died every year, and now no plants thus treated die with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p></div>

<p>The large trees may be fancifully set either in a
spot for the purpose, or through the garden. Put
bricks or pieces of wood under the tubs to prevent
them from rotting, and strew a little litter of any description
over the surface of the soil to prevent evaporation,
or about one inch of well decayed manure,
which will from the waterings help to enrich the soil.
A liberal supply of water twice or three times a week
is sufficient. A large tree will take at one time from
two to four gallons. We make this observation, for
many trees evidently have too limited a supply. Continue
to syringe the plants through the dry season every
evening, or at least three times per week. All the tall
plants must be tied to some firm support, because the
squalls of wind frequently overturn them, and do much
harm by breaking, &amp;c. Keep those that are in flower
as much in the shade as will preserve them from the
direct influence of the sun.</p>


<h4>REPOTTING PLANTS.</h4>

<p>After the following mentioned plants, or any assimilated
to them, are brought out of the house, and before
they are put in their respective stations, repot them
where they are required to grow well. <i>Aloes.</i> These
plants so varied in character, have been divided into
several genera. These are <i>Gast&egrave;ria</i>, <i>Pachid&eacute;ndron</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
<i>Riphidod&eacute;ndron</i>, <i>How&aacute;rthia</i>, and <i>Apicra</i>. Of these there
are above two hundred species and varieties. To enter
into any specific detail, would be beyond our limits; but
the catalogue at the end of the work will contain the
finest species.</p>

<p><i>Amaryllis.</i> This is a genus of splendid flowering bulbs
containing about eighty species, and one hundred and
forty varieties. They are natives of South America,
but more than one half of them are hybrids grown from
seed by cultivators. They are generally kept in the
Hot-house, but in our climate will do perfectly well in
the Green-house; and we have no doubt that in a few
years many of them will be so acclimated, as to keep
as garden bulbs, planting about the end of April, and
lifting them in October. As the beauty of these plants
is in the flowers, it will be proper to give a small description
of a few of them. <i>A. striatif&ograve;lia</i>, has a stripe
of pure white in the centre of each leaf, the flowers are
purple and white, an esteemed species. <i>A. Johns&ograve;ni</i>,
the flowers are a deep scarlet, with a white streak in
the centre of each petal, four bloom on a stem of about
two feet, each flower about six inches diameter; a bulb
well established has two stems. <i>A. reg&igrave;na</i>, Mexican
Lily, has large scarlet pendant flowers, tube of the
flower fringed-like, with three or four on the stem. <i>A.
vitt&agrave;ta</i> is an admired species with scarlet flowers, striped
with a greenish white. There are two or three varieties
of it; corolla campanulate, three or four on the stem, about
five inches diameter; petals a little undulate. <i>A. f&ugrave;lgida</i>,
flower scarlet, large tube striped, petals acute, two flowers
on the stem. <i>A. &aacute;ulica</i> is one of the most magnificent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
has four flowers about seven inches diameter, erect on a
stem about two and a half feet high; six petals, strongly
united to the capsule, bottom of the petals green, connected
with spots of dark crimson, which spread into
fine transparent red, covered with rich tints, nerves very
perceptible, anthers bold. It is called crowned <i>Amaryllis</i>.
<i>A. psitt&aacute;cina</i>, Parrot Amaryllis, is scarlet striped
with green, two flowers on the stem, each about five
inches diameter. There are several varieties of it; the
best that we have seen are <i>cowb&egrave;rgia</i> and <i>pulverul&egrave;nta</i>.
A bulb known in our collections as <i>A. purp&ugrave;rea</i> is <i>Ball&oacute;ta
purp&ugrave;rea</i>, has beautiful erect scarlet flowers, three or
four on the stem, each about five inches in diameter.
There are three varieties of it, differing only in habit.
<i>A. longif&ograve;lia</i> is now <i>Cr&igrave;num cap&eacute;nse</i>, and is perfectly hardy;
flowers pink, inclining to white, in large umbels, leaves
long, glaucous, and is a desirable garden bulb.</p>

<p>There are many other superb Amaryllis, especially the
hybrid sorts; from <i>Johns&ograve;ni</i> there are above twenty cultivated
varieties; from <i>form&ograve;sa</i> above twelve; and from
<i>Griff&igrave;ni</i> about ten, all of them esteemed. Where they
have been kept in the earth in which they were grown
last year, the ball ought at this repotting to be reduced;
when the bulbs are done flowering, they ought to have
little water, so that they may be perfectly ripened, which
will cause them to produce their flowers more freely.</p>

<p><i>Arauc&agrave;ria.</i> This noble genus contains four species,
which are without exception the handsomest plants we
are acquainted with, for the beauty of their foliage, and
symmetry of their growth, that belong to the Green-house.
<i>A. exc&eacute;lsa</i>, Norfolk Island Pine, has leaves closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
imbricated as if with a coat of mail, and are imperishable.
<i>A. imbric&agrave;ta</i>, Chile Pine, is one of the grandest of
trees, and is the hardiest of the genus; the leaves are
also closely imbricated. The other two species are
rarely seen even in European collections. The foliage
of either of the species will adhere to the wood many
years after the plant is dead. They are all highly valued,
the pots must be well drained; for if the plants get much
water while dormant, the foliage becomes yellow, and
never attains its beautiful green colour again; otherwise
they are easily grown.</p>

<p><i>Cham&aelig;rops.</i> There are about seven species of these
palms: four of them belong to this department, and are
the finest of those that will keep in the Green-house.
They all have large palmated fronds, and require large
pots or tubs to make them grow freely, and are tenacious
of life if kept from frost.</p>

<p><i>Gard&egrave;nia.</i> This is an esteemed genus of plants, especially
for the double flowering varieties, which are highly
odoriferous, and have an evergreen shining foliage. <i>G.
fl&ograve;rida fl&ograve;re-pl&egrave;no</i>, Cape Jasmine, is a plant universally
known in our collections, and trees of it are frequently
seen above seven feet high and five feet in diameter,
blooming from June to October. <i>G. r&aacute;dicans</i>, dwarf
Cape Jasmine, <i>G. longif&ograve;lia</i>, and <i>G. latif&ograve;lia</i>, are also in
several collections, but not so generally known; the
flowers are double, and all equally fragrant. We are
inclined to think they are only varieties of <i>G. fl&ograve;rida</i>.
Any of the above will keep in the coldest part of the
Green-house, and even under the stage is a good situation
for them, where the house is otherwise crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
during winter. They must be sparingly watered from
November to March. Much water while they are dormant,
gives the foliage a sickly tinge, a state in which
they are too frequently seen. <i>G. Rothm&agrave;nnia</i> and <i>G.
Thunb&eacute;rgia</i> are fine plants, but flower sparingly; the
flowers of the former are spotted, and are most fragrant
during night.</p>

<p><i>Mesembry&agrave;nthemum.</i> A very extensive genus, containing
upwards of four hundred and fifty species, and varieties,
with few exceptions natives of the Cape of Good
Hope. They are all singular, many of them beautiful,
and some splendid; yet they have never been popular
plants in our collections. The leaves are almost of
every shape and form; their habits vary in appearance.
Some of them are straggling, others insignificant, and
a few grotesque. When they are well grown, they
flower in great profusion; the colours are brilliant, and
through the genus are found of every shade; yellow and
white are most prevalent. Each species continues a
considerable time in flower. The flowers are either
solitary, axillary, extra axillary, but most frequently terminale;
leaves mostly opposite, thick, or succulent, and
of various forms. They are sometimes kept in the
Hot-house, but undoubtedly the Green-house is the best
situation for them. They must not get water above
once a month during winter, but while they are in flower
and through the summer, they require a more liberal
supply, and they seldom need to be repotted; once in
two years is sufficient.</p>

<p><i>Strel&iacute;tzia</i>, a most superb genus of evergreen perennial
plants. They are greatly esteemed and highly valued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
in our collections. The finest flowering species are <i>S.
reg&igrave;n&aelig;</i> and <i>S. ov&aacute;ta</i>; the former is the strongest of the
two, but in respect to the beauty of their flowers there
is no difference. The scape arises about three feet,
headed with a sheath which lies horizontal before the
flowers burst forth. The sheath contains three, four,
or five flowers, according to the strength of the plants.
These arise erect, and pass in a few days to the bottom
of the sheath, the one before the other. <i>S. h&ugrave;milis</i> is another
fine species, but the most rare are <i>S. ag&uacute;sta</i>,
which has a leaf nearly like the plantain; <i>S. j&ugrave;ncea</i>, <i>S.
parvif&ograve;lia</i>, and <i>S. farin&ograve;so</i>. The flowers of all these are
yellow and blue, except those of <i>S. ag&uacute;sta</i>, which are
white, and it flowers sparingly. A few species of these
plants ought to be in every Green-house: they are vulgarly
called Queen plant. While in flower they should
be liberally supplied with water, but while dormant
very sparingly. They will suffer sooner from the effects
of too much, than too little water. The roots are
strong tubers, and require plenty of pot room, and will
thrive exceedingly where they can be planted in the
soil.</p>


<h4>CAMELLIAS.</h4>

<p>These plants, when they are brought from the Green-house,
ought to be set in a situation by themselves,
that they may be the more strictly attended to in watering
and syringing. An airy situation where the sun has
no effect upon them is the best. They should be syringed
every evening when there has been no rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
through the day. After heavy rains examine the pots,
and where water is found, turn the plant on its side
for a few hours to let the water pass off, and then examine
the draining in the bottom of the pots, which must
be defective.</p>


<h4>CAPE BULBS.</h4>

<p>As soon as these are done flowering, and the foliage
begins to decay, cease watering, and turn the pots on
their sides, until the soil is perfectly dry; then take out
the bulbs and preserve them dry until the time of planting,
which will be about the end of August or first of
September.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Flower_Garden4" id="Flower_Garden4"><span class="antiqua">Flower Garden.</span></a></h2>


<h3><i>MAY.</i></h3>

<p>It is highly desirable to have all the scientific operations
as much advanced in the beginning of this month
as is practicable, that at all times immediate attention
may be given to the destroying of weeds wherever they
appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>


<h4>ANNUALS, HARDY AND TENDER.</h4>

<p>By the first of the month finish sowing all hardy Annuals
and Biennials; and about the middle of the
month all those that are tropical. The weather being
now warm, they will vegetate in a few days or weeks.
Attend to thinning of those that are too thick, giving
gentle waterings to such as are weak in dry weather.
Those that have been protected in frames should be
fully exposed therein night and day; take the first opportunity
of damp cloudy days to have them transplanted
into the borders or beds, after the 10th, lifting them
out of the frame with as much earth as will adhere to
their roots.</p>


<h4>CARE OF HYACINTHS, TULIPS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>For the treatment of these while in bloom, see last
month. The best time to take them out of the ground
is about five weeks after they are done flowering, or
when the stem appears, what may be termed half decayed.
The best method to dry them is to place the
roots in rows, with bulb to bulb, the stems laying north
and south, or east or west. Give the bulbs a very thin
covering of earth, merely to exclude the sun, so that
they may not dry too rapidly, being thereby liable to
become soft. When they have thoroughly dried in
this situation, which will be in eight or ten days in dry
weather, (and if it rains cover them with boards,) take
them to an airy dry loft or shade, clearing off the fibres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
or stems, and in a few weeks put them in close drawers,
or cover them with sand perfectly dry, until the time of
planting, for which see October.</p>

<p>It is not advisable to allow any of the bulbs of either
Hyacinths or Tulips to seed, as it retards their ripening,
and weakens the root, except where there are a
few desired for new varieties. The small offsets must
be carefully kept in dry sand, or immediately planted.</p>


<h4>ANEMONES AND RANUNCULUS.</h4>

<p>These while in bloom should be carefully shaded
from the sun by hoops and thin canvass, or an erect
temporary awning; and as soon as they are done
flowering, they must be fully exposed, and the waterings
given up.</p>


<h4>DAHLIAS, TUBEROSES, AND AMARYLLIS,</h4>

<p>That are not planted, should now be done. For full
directions see last month. In many seasons, any time
before the twelfth is quite soon enough; but nothing
ought to be delayed when the season will permit it to be
done. It is necessary to have them properly labeled.</p>


<h4>AURICULAS, POLYANTHUS, AND PRIMROSES.</h4>

<p>They will now be done flowering, but still must be
carefully kept in a cool, shady situation, and all decayed
leaves cut off as soon as they appear. Examine
them carefully and frequently, in case slugs of any de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>scription
be preying upon them. A dusting of hot lime
will kill them, or they may be otherwise destroyed.
Some have recommended to repot and slip those plants
when done flowering, "or they will contract a destructive
disease;" which disease is a loss of verdure, and is
induced by too much heat and drought, and a few other
causes from inattention; but if attended to as above
until September, when they should be fresh potted, they
will have time to be sufficiently established before winter,
which is the most judicious time to take off slips,
for two reasons, viz.&mdash;they do not need so much nursing
through the most precarious season of the year
(summer) for these plants, and they begin to grow,
and will root afresh sooner.</p>


<h4>DOUBLE WALL-FLOWERS.</h4>

<p>As these are very seldom grown from seed, and are
semi-biennials, art has to be used to preserve or renew
them. About the end of this month take shoots of this
year about three inches long, cutting them carefully
off, and smoothing the cut end with a sharp knife;
from this cut the lower leaves off about one inch and
a half, and then put it in the ground; choose a
very shady spot, mixing the soil with a little sand and
earth of decayed leaves. Sprinkle them three times a
day until they have taken root, which will be in a few
weeks. Keep the cuttings about four inches apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>


<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>We do not consider that it is essential every month
to repeat the necessity of tying up plants, saving seeds
when ripe, cutting down weeds, raking, &amp;c. with many
other similar observations. We have already been full
on these subjects, and expect these to be remembered
through the season. Particular care, however, is required
to <i>carnations</i>, <i>pinks</i>, or any plants that have heavy
heads and slender stems. If carnations are desired to
flower strongly, cut off all the buds except three, leaving
the uppermost and any other two of the largest.
All climbing plants should have timely support, and
tied securely every week while they are growing.</p>

<h3><a name="MAY" id="MAY"><i>MAY.</i></a></h3>


<p>All the plants will be able to withstand exposure, in
the general state of the seasons, about the 10th of the
month. Begin about the first to take out the hardiest,
such as <i>Laurest&iacute;nus</i>, <i>Hydr&aacute;ngeas</i>, <i>Roses</i>, <i>Primroses</i>, <i>Polyanthus</i>,
&amp;c. and thus allow the others to stand more
free, and become hardened to exposure. The reason
that plants are so often seen brown, stunted, and almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
half dead, is from the exposed situation they are placed
in, with the direct sun upon them, and too frequently from
being so sparingly watered. There are no shrubby
plants cultivated in pots that are benefited by the hot sun
from this period to October. A north aspect is the
best for every plant, except <i>C&agrave;ctus</i>, <i>Aloe</i>, <i>Mesembry&agrave;nthemum</i>,
and such as go under the name of succulents.
Where there are only a few, they should be conveniently
placed, to allow water from a pot with a rose mouth
to be poured frequently over them, which is the best substitute
for the syringe. <i>D&aacute;phne</i>, <i>Coron&iacute;lla</i>, <i>F&uacute;chsia</i>, <i>Cam&eacute;llia</i>,
<i>Primrose</i>, and <i>Poly&aacute;nthus</i>, do not agree with a single
ray of the sun, through the summer. There has been a
general question what is the cause of the death of so
many of the <i>D&aacute;phne od&ograve;ra</i>. It may be observed, that
the first place that shows symptoms of decay, is at the
surface of the soil, and this takes place a few weeks
before there are evident effects of it. The cause is
from the effect of heat or sun and water acting on the
stem at least. If the soil is drawn in the form of a
cone round the stem, to throw off the water to the
edges of the pot, that the stem may be dry above the
roots, mortification does not take place, neither do
they die prematurely, when thus treated. For further
remarks, see Green-house, this month.</p>


<h4>CAPE BULBS.</h4>

<p>Any of these that are done flowering, such as <i>Ixia</i>,
<i>Oxalis</i>, <i>Lachen&agrave;lia</i>, &amp;c. as soon as the foliage begins to
decay, turn the pots on their sides, which will ripen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
roots, and when perfectly dry, clear them off the soil,
wrap them up in paper, with their names attached, and
put them carefully aside until the time of planting.</p>


<h4>REPOTTING.</h4>

<p>Where it is required, repot <i>C&aacute;ctus</i>, <i>Aloe</i>, <i>Mesembry&aacute;nthemums</i>,
and all other succulents, with any of the
<i>Amaryllis</i> that are required to be kept in pots, also Cape
Jasmines. For description of the above, see Hot-house
and Green-house of this month, under the same
head.</p>

<h3><i>JUNE AND JULY.</i></h3>


<p>As the plants of the Hot-house are all exposed to
the open air, the directions will include both months.
If the repotting is over, as recommended last month,
all the attention they will require until the end of August,
is the administering of water at the roots, and by
the syringe over head. It will be impossible to say
how great are their wants, that depending entirely upon
the nature of the plant, the situation, and the season;
but never neglect to look over them every evening, and
after very dry nights they will need a fresh supply in
the morning, observing to give to none except they are
becoming a little dry. Make weekly examinations for
insects of any description, and when they appear, have
them instantly destroyed.</p>

<p>Always after heavy rains look over the pots, in case
water should be standing in them, which would injure
the roots. Where any is found, turn the pot on its
side, and in a few hours examine the draining which is
defective; small pots in continued rains should be turned
likewise.</p>

<p>Tie up all plants and shoots to prevent them from
being destroyed by the wind, and be attentive to pick
all weeds from the pots. Turn round all the plants occasionally,
to prevent them from being drawn to one
side by the sun or light.</p>

<h3><i>JUNE AND JULY.</i></h3>


<p>The plants being out of the house, there need be little
added under this head. Their treatment is in the
general, and the required attention is in giving water
according to their different constitutions and habits.
Where there are not rain or river water, it should stand
at least one day in butts or cisterns, to take the chilly
air from it, and become softened by the surrounding
atmosphere. This is more essential to the health of
the plants than is generally supposed. The small plants
in dry weather will need water evening and morning.
Continue regular syringings as directed last month.
There are frequently rains continuing for several days,
which will materially injure many plants, if they are not
turned on their sides until the rain is over, especially
small plants. The syringings should never be done
till after the waterings at the roots, and they should
never be seldomer than every alternate evening. Turn
all the plants frequently to prevent them from being
drawn to one side by the sun or light. Carefully look
over them at these turnings, to detect any insects. And
observe that the tuberose rooted geraniums, such as
<i>Ard&eacute;ns</i>, <i>Bic&ograve;lor</i>, <i>Tr&iacute;stum</i>, &amp;c. are not getting too much
water, they being now dormant.</p>

<h4>HOLLAND BULBS.</h4>

<p>The lifting of these will be general in June. For directions
see <i>May</i>. It is not advisable to take up <i>Jonquils</i>,
<i>Fritill&agrave;ria</i>, <i>Crocus</i>, and <i>Iris</i>, oftener than every
alternate year; <i>Jonquils</i> may stand three years. <i>Anemones</i>
and <i>Ranunculus</i> should be carefully lifted after their
leaves begin to fade. Do not expose them to the sun,
but cover slightly with earth or sand until they are
perfectly dry, when they may be sifted out of the earth,
and put into drawers carefully labeled. Some recommend
to soak these roots in soap-suds, to destroy a
worm that they are frequently attacked with. We
know not how far this may be carried, nor the good or
bad effects, never having practised it.</p>


<h4>AUTUMN FLOWERING BULBS.</h4>

<p>These are <i>Amaryllis l&ugrave;tea</i>, now called <i>Sternb&eacute;rgia l&ugrave;tea</i>;
<i>A. Bellad&oacute;nna</i>, now <i>Bellad&oacute;nna purpur&aacute;scens</i>; and <i>Ner&igrave;ne
sarni&eacute;nsis</i>. This is a beautiful flowering bulb, and requires
the protection of a frame during winter. The
old bulb seldom flowers oftener than two succeeding
years, and then decays, but the off-sets will flower the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
second year; therefore when the old bulbs are lifted,
they ought to be immediately planted, and receive every
encouragement to strengthen them for flowering.
<i>Crôcus sat&igrave;vus</i>, <i>C Pall&agrave;sii</i>, <i>C. serot&igrave;nus</i>, and <i>C. nudifl&ograve;rus</i>,
and all the species of <i>C&oacute;lchicum</i>, with species of several
other genera not introduced into the country. They
should all be lifted as soon as the foliage is decayed,
and kept only a few weeks out of the ground, and then
again replanted in fresh soil. The economy of the
genus <i>C&oacute;lchicum</i> in regard to its bulbs, flowers, and seeds,
is altogether singular, and may be termed an anomaly
of nature. In producing the new bulbs or off-sets in a
very curious manner, the old one perishes. The flowers
which arise with long slender tubes from the root die
off in October, without leaving any external appearance
of seeds. These lie buried all the winter within the
bulb, in spring they grow upon a fruit stalk, and are
ripe about the first of June. How beautiful and admirable
is this provision! The plant blooming so late in
the year, would not have time to mature its seeds before
winter; and is, therefore, so contrived that it may
be performed out of the reach of the usual effects of
frost, and they are brought above the surface when
perfected, and at a proper season for sowing.</p>


<h4>CARNATIONS AND PINKS.</h4>

<p>In order to make the former flower well, if the weather
is dry, give them frequent waterings at the root,
and tie them up neatly to their rods. The criterion of
a fine carnation is&mdash;the stem strong and straight, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
thirty to forty inches high, the corolla three inches diameter,
consisting of large round well formed petals, but
not so many as to crowd it, nor so few as to make it
appear thin or empty; the outside petals should rise
above the calyx about half an inch, and then turn off
in a horizontal direction, to support the interior petals,
they forming nearly a hemispherical corolla. The interior
petals should decrease in size toward the centre,
all regularly disposed on every side; they should have
a small degree of concavity at the lamina or broad end,
the edges perfectly entire. The calyx above one inch
in length, with strong broad points in a close and circular
body. The colours must be perfectly distinct,
disposed in regular long stripes, broadest at the edge
of the lamina, and gradually becoming narrower as they
approach the unguis or base of the petal, there terminating
in a fine point. Those that contain two colours
upon a white ground are esteemed the finest.</p>

<p>Of a double pink&mdash;the stem about twelve inches, the
calyx smaller but similar to a carnation; the flowers
two inches and a half in diameter; petals rose edges;
colour white, and pure purple, or rich crimson; the
nearer it approaches to black it is the more esteemed;
proportions equal as in carnation. Those that are very
tasteful with these flowers are attentive to the manner of
their opening. Where the calyx is deficient in regular
expansion to display the petals; that is, where there is
a tendency to burst open on one side more than on
the other, the opposite side in two or three different
indentions should be slit a little at several times with
the point of a small sharp knife, taking care not to cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the petals, and about the centre of the calyx tie a thread
three or four times round to prevent any farther irregularity.
Some florists and connoisseurs place cards
on them. This is done when the calyx is small. Take
a piece of thin pasteboard, about the size of a dollar;
cut a small aperture in its centre to admit the bud to
pass through. When on tie it tight to the rod, to prevent
the wind from blowing it about; and when the
flower is expanded, draw up the card to about the middle
of the calyx, and spread the petals one over the other
regularly upon it. When these plants are in flower,
their beauty may be prolonged by giving them a little
shade from the mid-day sun by an awning of any simple
description. Where they are in pots, they can be removed
to a cool shady situation, (but not directly under
trees.)</p>


<h4>OF LAYING CARNATIONS AND PINKS.</h4>

<p>This is a necessary and yearly operation to keep a
supply of plants, and likewise to have them always in
perfection. As the process of laying, though simple, may
not be known to all who are desirous of cultivating
these plants, we will give an outline of the mode of
operation. Provide first a quantity of small hooked
twigs (pieces of <i>Asparagus</i> stems are very suitable)
about three inches long, for pegging the layers down in
the earth. Select the outward strongest and lowest
shoots that are round the plant, trim off a few of the
under leaves, and shorten with the knife the top ones
even, and then applying it at a joint about the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
of the under-side of the shoot, cut about half through
in a slanting direction, making an upward slit towards
the next joint, near an inch in extent; and loosening
the earth, make a small oblong cavity one or two inches
deep, putting a little fresh light earth therein. Lay
the stem part where the slit is made into the earth,
keeping the cut part open, and the head of the layer
upright one or two inches out of the earth; and in that
position peg down the layer with one of the hooked
twigs, and cover the inserted part to the depth of one
inch with some of the fresh earth, pressing it gently
down. In this manner proceed to lay all the proper
shoots of each plant. Keep the earth a little full round
the plant, to retain longer the water that may be applied.
Give immediately a moderate watering, with
a rose watering pot, and in dry weather give light waterings
every evening. Choose a cloudy day for the above
operation. In about two months they will be well
rooted.</p>


<h4>PRUNING ROSES.</h4>

<p>The best time to prune what are termed "Garden
roses" is immediately after flowering, which is generally
about the middle of June. Cut out all old exhausted
wood, and where it is too thick and crowded, shortening
those shoots which have flowered to a good fresh
strong eye, or bud, accompanied with a healthy leaf,
but leaving untouched such shoots as are still in a growing
state, except where they are becoming irregular.
Such should be cut to the desired shape. There is not
a better period of the year for puting these bushes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
handsome order, which ought to be studied. All wood
that grows after this pruning will ripen perfectly and
produce fine flowers next year.</p>

<p>Our reasons for doing so at this period are these:
The points of the shoots of the more delicate sorts of
roses are very apt to die when pruned in winter or
spring; hence the consequences of this evil are avoided.
The stronger the wood of roses is made to grow,
the flowers will be the larger and more profuse, and
this effect is but produced by cutting out the old and
superfluous wood; at least it prevents any loss of vegetative
power, which ought always to be considered.</p>


<h4>OF BUDDING OR INOCULATION OF ROSES.</h4>

<p>According to what we have previously hinted in regard
to having roses as standards, where such are desired,
the month of July is a proper time for the operation
of budding. The kinds to be taken for stocks should
be of a strong free growth. Such as <i>Ornamental parade</i>;
<i>Dutch tree</i>; <i>R. vil&ograve;sa</i>; <i>R. can&iacute;na</i>; and frequently the French
<i>Eglantine</i>, are taken. Be provided with a proper budding-knife,
which has a sharp thin blade adapted to
prepare the bud, with a tapering ivory haft made thin
at the end for raising the bark of the stock. For tieings
use bass strings from Russia mats, which should be
soaked in water to make them more pliable. The
height of the stock or stem at which the bud is to be
inserted, is to be determined by the intended destination
of the tree, (as it may be properly called.) Choose
a smooth part of the stem, from one to three years old.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Having marked the place, prune away all the lateral
shoots about and underneath it. With the knife directed
horizontally, make an incision about half an inch long
in the bark of the stock, cutting into the wood, but not
deeper; then applying the point of the knife to the middle
of this line, make a perpendicular incision under
the first, extending from it between one and two inches.
Having a healthy shoot of the growth of this year provided
of the kind that is desired, begin at the lower end
of this shoot, cut away all the leaves, leaving the footstalk
of each. Being fixed on a promising bud, insert
the knife about half an inch above the eye, slanting it
downwards, and about half through the shoot. Draw it
out about an inch below the eye, so as to bring
away the bud unimpaired with the bark, and part of the
wood adhering to it; the wood now must be carefully
detached from the bark. To do this insert the point of
the knife between the bark and wood at one end, and
holding the bark tenderly, strip off the woody part,
which will readily part from the bark if the shoot from
which the piece is taken has been properly imbued with
sap.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> Look at the inner rind of the separated bark, to
see if that be entire; if there be a hole in it, the eye of the
bud has been pulled away with the wood, rendering the
bud useless, which throw away; if there be no hole, return
to the stock, and with the haft of the knife gently
raise the bark on each side of the perpendicular incision,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
opening the lips wide enough to admit the prepared
slip with the eye. If the slip is longer than the upright
incision in the stock, reduce the largest end. Stock
and bud being ready, keep the latter in its natural position,
introduce it between the bark and wood of the
stock, pushing it gently downwards until it reaches the
bottom of the perpendicular incision. Let the eye of
the bud project through the centre of the lips; lay the
slip with the bud as smooth as possible, and press down
the raised bark of the stock. The bud being deposited,
bind that part of the stock moderately tight with bass,
beginning a little below the incision, proceeding upward
so as to keep the eye uncovered, finishing above the incision.
In a month after the operation, examine whether
the bud has united with the stock. If it has succeeded,
the bud will be full and fresh; if not, it will be brown
and contracted. When it has taken, untie the bandage,
that the bud may swell, and in a few days afterwards cut
the head of the stock off about six inches above the inoculation,
and prevent all shoots from growing by pinching
them off. This will forward the bud, which will push
and ripen wood this season; but it must be carefully
tied as it grows to the remaining head of the stock.
Some do not head down the stock until the following
spring, thereby not encouraging the bud to grow, which
if winter sets in early is the safest method.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> We once budded three eyes of the white moss rose, after they had by mistake
been carried in the pocket of a coat three days. The shoot was soaked six hours
in water, and two of the buds grew. From this we infer that shoots, if properly
wrapped up, may be carried very great distances, and grow successfully.</p></div>


<h4>OF WATERING.</h4>

<p>If the season is dry, look over the late planted shrubs,
and give them frequent copious waterings; and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
of the finest annuals that are wanted to flower perfectly
should be attended to. <i>Dahlias</i> suffer very much in
dry seasons, therefore it is advisable to water the most
beautiful (or all) of them two or three times per week,
and be careful to tie up their shoots to any support that
is given to them, in case of high winds breaking or
otherwise destroying the flower stems.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Rooms5" id="Rooms5"><span class="antiqua">Rooms.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>JUNE AND JULY.</i></h3>


<p>The only attention requisite to <i>these</i> plants, is in giving
water, keeping them from being much exposed to
either sun or high winds, and preventing the attack of
insects. Water must be regularly given every evening,
when there has not been rain during the day. Where
they are in a growing state, they are not liable at this
season of the year to suffer from too much water, except
in a few instances, such as the Lemon-scented
Geranium, and those kinds that are tuberose rooted,
as <i>Ard&egrave;ns</i>, <i>Bic&ograve;lor</i>, <i>Trist&uacute;m</i>, &amp;c. which should have
moderate supplies.</p>

<p>All the plants ought to be turned round every few
weeks to prevent them from growing to one side, by
the one being more dark than the other, and keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
those of a straggling growth tied neatly to rods.
Wherever insects of any description appear, wash them
off directly. Give regular syringings or sprinklings
from the rose of a watering pot. Be particularly attentive
in this respect to the <i>Cam&eacute;llias</i>, which will keep
the foliage in a healthy state, and prevent the effects
of mildew.</p>

<p>If the foliage of <i>L&iacute;lium longifl&ograve;rum</i>, or <i>jap&oacute;nicum</i>, has
died down, do not water them while dormant, as they
are easily injured by such treatment.</p>

<h2><a name="Hot-House6" id="Hot-House6"><span class="antiqua">Hot-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>AUGUST.</i></h3>


<p>The plants of the Hot-house that were repotted in
May and June, according to the directions therein given,
will at present be in an excellent state of health, provided
they have got at all times the requisite supplies of watering.
And as we already have been very explicit on
that subject, more remarks now would be merely repetition.</p>


<h4>REPOTTING.</h4>

<p>If any of the repottings were neglected, during May
or June, let it be done about the first of this month.
Let young plants that are growing freely, where the
roots have filled the pots, and the plants required to
grow, have pots one size larger. In turning out the
ball of earth, keep it entire, not disturbing any of the
roots.</p>


<h4>OF PAINTING, REPAIRING, AND CLEANSING THE HOUSE.</h4>

<p>The necessary repairs of the Hot-house are too often
put off to the last day or week; and then with hurry
are superficially attended to. Previous to the first of
September, have all the wood-work painted; which
ought to have one coat every year, and the glass all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
repaired. Have the flues and furnace examined, and
all rents plastered over, or any deficiency made good.
Give the flue a thick coat of lime white-wash, and properly
white-wash the whole interior stages and shelves
to destroy any larv&aelig; of insects; or, what is preferable
for the latter, use oil paint. If there is a tan bed, have
that renewed; take out what is most decayed, and add
new tan. Wash out the floor perfectly clean, so that
all may be in readiness for the plants next month.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="GREEN-HOUSE6" id="GREEN-HOUSE6"><span class="antiqua">Green-house.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>AUGUST.</i></h3>


<p>Any of the <i>Myrtles</i>, <i>Oranges</i>, <i>Lemons</i>, <i>Oleanders</i>, &amp;c. that
were headed down in April or May, will be pushing many
young shoots. The plant must be carefully examined,
to observe which of the shoots ought to be left to form
the tree. Having determined on this, cut out all the
others close to the stem with a small sharp knife; and if
the remaining shoots are above one foot long, pinch
off the tops to make them branch out.</p>

<p>The trees that were entirely headed down, should
not have above six shoots left, which will, by being
topped, make a sufficient quantity to form the bush or
tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>


<h4>GERANIUMS.</h4>

<p>These plants, about the first of the month, require a
complete dressing. In the first place collect them all
together, and with a sharp knife cut off the wood of
this year to within a few eyes of the wood of last year.
<i>Citriod&oacute;rum</i> and its varieties do not need pruning. The
plants grown from cuttings during the season, that
have flowered, cut them to about four inches from the
pot. This being done, have the earth all prepared
with potshreds or fine gravel for draining the delicate
kinds. And in a shaded situation turn the plants progressively
out of the pots they are in, reducing the balls
of earth so that the same pots may contain them again,
and allow from half an inch to two inches, according
to the size of the pot, of fresh soil around the ball, which
press down by a thin piece of wood cut for the purpose.
Finish by leveling all neatly with the hand. Give very
gentle waterings from a pot with a rose mouth, for a
few weeks, until they have begun to grow, protecting
them entirely from the sun, till that period, then take
the opportunity of a cloudy day to expose them. After
this repotting, the following kinds are liable to suffer
from too much water: <i>Pavon&iacute;num</i>, <i>Davey[)a]num</i>, <i>f&uacute;lgens</i>,
<i>ardens</i>, <i>citriod&oacute;rum</i>, <i>rub&eacute;scens</i>, <i>florab&ugrave;ndum</i>, <i>ard&egrave;scens</i>; with
those of a similar habit, and these species do not require
so much encouragement at the root as the strong
growing sorts. The tuberous rooted and deciduous
species must be very moderately supplied. Be careful
when watering that the new soil does not become sa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>turated
with water, as, though allowed to dry again, it
will not be so pure. When they shoot afresh, turn
them regularly every two weeks, to prevent them growing
to one side.</p>


<h4>ORANGES, LEMONS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>As it is frequently very inconvenient to shift these
trees into larger tubs in the months of March and April,
this month is a period that is suitable both from the
growth of the trees, and their being in the open air. It
would be improper to state the day or the week, that
depending entirely on the season. The criterion is
easily observed, which is when the first growth is over,
these trees making another growth in autumn. When
they are large, they require great exertion, and are frequently
attended with inconvenience to get them shifted.
Where there is a quantity of them, the best plan
that we have tried or seen adopted is as follows: Have a
strong double and a single block trimmed with a sufficiency
of rope; make it fast to the limb of a large tree, or
any thing that projects, and will bear the weight, and as
high as will admit of the plant being raised a few feet
under it. Take a soft bandage and put around the
stem, to prevent the bark from being bruised; make
a rope fast to it, in which hook the single block. Raise
the plant the height of the tub, put a spar across the
tub, and strike on the spar with a mallet, which will
separate the tub from the ball. Then with a strong
pointed stick probe a little of the earth from amongst
the roots, observing to cut away any that are affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
by dry-rot, damp, or mildew, with any very matted
roots. Having all dressed, place a few potshreds over
the hole or holes in the bottom of the tub; measure
exactly the depth of the ball that remains around the
plant, and fill up with earth, pressing it a little with the
hand, until it will hold the ball one inch under the edge
of the tub. If there is from four to six inches of earth
under it, it is quite enough. Fill all around the ball,
and press it down with a stick, finishing neatly off with
the hand. Observe that the stem of the tree is exactly
in the centre. This being done, carry the tree to where
it is intended to stand, and give it water with a rose on
the pot. The earth will subside about two inches,
thus leaving three inches, which will at any time hold
enough of water for the tree. Trees thus treated will
not require to be shifted again within four or five years,
having in the interim got a few rich top-dressings.</p>

<p>Frequently in attempting to take out of the tubs those
that are in a sickly state, all the soil falls from their
roots, having no fibres attached. When there are any
such, after replanting, put them in the Green-house, and
shut it almost close up, there give shade to the tree,
and frequent sprinklings of water, until it begins to grow,
when admit more air gradually until it becomes hardened.
These trees should be put in very small tubs,
and a little sand added to the soil. Give very moderate
supplies of water, merely keeping the soil moist. Tubs
generally give way at the bottom when they begin to
decay, and in the usual method of coopering after this
failure they are useless, the ledging being rotten, and
will not admit of another bottom. The staves should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
be made without any groove, and have four brackets
nailed on the inside, having the bottom in a piece by
itself that it can be placed on these brackets, and there
is no necessity of it being water tight. Then when it
fails, it can be replaced again at a trifling expense. A
tub made this way will last out three or four bottoms,
and is in every respect the cheapest, and should be
more wide than deep. <i>Large Myrtles</i> and <i>Oleanders</i> may
be treated in the same manner as directed for the
above.</p>


<h4>OF PRUNING ORANGES, LEMONS, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>These trees will grow very irregularly, especially the
<i>Lemon</i>, if not frequently dressed or pruned. Any time
this month look over them all minutely, and cut away
any of the small naked wood where it is too crowded,
and cut all young strong straggling shoots to the
bounds of the tree, giving it a round regular head. It is
sometimes necessary to cut out a small limb, but large
amputations should be avoided. Cover all wounds
with turpentine or bees-wax, to prevent the bad effects
of the air.</p>


<h4>OF REPOTTING PLANTS.</h4>

<p>Any of the plants enumerated in March under this
head, may be now done according to directions therein
given, and which apply to all sizes. This is the proper
period for repotting the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>C&aacute;lla</i>, a genus of four species. None of them in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
collections, and in fact are not worth cultivation, except
<i>C. &aelig;thi&ograve;pica</i>, Ethiopian Lily, which is admired for the
purity and singularity of its large white flowers, or rather
spatha, which is cucullate, leaves sagittate. It is now
called <i>Rich&aacute;rdia &aelig;thi&oacute;pica</i>. The roots which are tubers
should be entirely divested of the soil they have been
grown in, breaking off any small offsets, and potting
them wholly in fresh earth. When growing they cannot
get too much water. The plant will grow in a pond of
water, and withstand our severest winters, provided the
roots are kept at the bottom of the water.</p>

<p><i>Cyclamen.</i> There are eight species and six varieties
of this genus, which consists of humble plants with very
beautiful flowers. The bulbs are round, flattened, and
solid, and are peculiarly adapted for pots and the decorating
of rooms. <i>C. côum</i>, leaves almost round;
flowers light red; in bloom from January to April. <i>C.
p&eacute;rsicum</i>, with its four varieties, flower from February
to April; colour white, and some white and purple.
<i>C. heder&aelig;f&ograve;lium</i>, Ivy-leaved; colour lilac; there is a white
variety; flowers from July to September. <i>C. Europ&aelig;um</i>,
colour lilac, in bloom from August to October. <i>C. neapolit&agrave;num</i>,
flowers red, in bloom from July to September.
These are all desirable plants. When the foliage
begins to decay, withhold the accustomed supplies of
water, keeping them in a half dry state; and when growing
they must not be over watered, as they are apt to
rot from moisture. Keep them during the summer
months in the shade. The best time for potting either
of the sorts is when the crown of the bulb begins
to protrude. If the pots are becoming large, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
alternate year they may be cleared from the old soil,
and put in smaller pots with the crown barely covered.
When the flowers fade, the pedicles twist up like a
screw, inclosing the germen in the centre, lying close
to the ground until the seeds ripen, from which plants
can be grown, and will flower the third year.</p>

<p><i>Lachen&agrave;lia</i>, a genus of about forty species of bulbs,
all natives of the Cape of Good Hope, and grow remarkably
well in our collections. The most common
is <i>L. tr&iacute;color</i>. <i>L. quadr&iacute;color</i>, and its varieties, are all
fine; the colours yellow, scarlet, orange, and green,
very pure and distinct; <i>L. r&ugrave;bida</i>. <i>L. punct&agrave;ta</i>, <i>L. orcho&iacute;des</i>,
and <i>L. nerv&ograve;sa</i>, are all fine species. The flowers
are on a stem from a half to one foot high, and much in
the character of a hyacinth. The end of the month is
about the time of planting. Five inch pots are large
enough, and they must get very little water till they begin
to grow.</p>

<p><i>Oxalis</i>, above one hundred species of Cape bulbs,
and like all other bulbs of that country, they do exceedingly
well in our collections, in which there are only
comparatively a few species, not exceeding twelve. <i>O.
rub&egrave;lla</i>, branching, of a vermilion colour; <i>O. margin&agrave;ta</i>,
white; <i>O. elong&agrave;ta</i>, striped; and <i>O. am&aelig;na</i>, are those
that require potting this month. The first of September
is the most proper period for the others.</p>

<p>This genus of plants is so varied in the construction
of its roots, that the same treatment will not do for all.
The root is commonly bulbous, and these will keep a
few weeks or months out of the soil, according to their
size. Several are only thick and fleshy: these ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
not to be taken out of the pots, but kept in them, while
dormant; and about the end of this month give them
gentle waterings. When they begin to grow, take the
earth from the roots, and pot them in fresh soil. In a
few years the bulbs are curiously produced, the original
bulb near the surface striking a radical fibre downright
from its base, at the extremity of which is produced
a new bulb for the next year's plant, the old one
perishing.</p>

<p><i>Ornith&oacute;galum</i>, Star of Bethlehem, about sixty species
of bulbs, principally from the Cape of Good Hope.
Many of them have little attraction. The most beautiful
that we have seen are <i>O. lact&eacute;um</i>, which has a
spike about one foot long of fine white flowers; and <i>O.
a&ugrave;reum</i>, flowers of a golden colour, in contracted racemose
corymbs. These two are magnificent. <i>O. mar&iacute;timum</i>
is the officinale squill. The bulb is frequently
as large as a human head, pear-shaped, and tunicated
like the onion. From the centre of the root arise several
shining glaucous leaves a foot long, two inches
broad at base, and narrowing to a point. They are
green during winter, and decay in the spring; then the
flower-stalk comes out, rising two feet, naked half way,
and terminated by a pyramidal thyrse of white flowers.
The bulb ought to be kept dry from the end of June
till now, or it will not flower freely.</p>


<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>Watering, and other practical care of the plants, to
be done as heretofore described. Frequently the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
weather at the end of this month becomes cool and
heavy. Dew falling through the night will in part supply
the syringing operation, but it must not be suspended
altogether. Three times a week will suffice. Any
of the plants that are plunged should be turned every
week. In wet weather observe that none are suffering
from moisture.</p>

<h3><i>AUGUST.</i></h3>


<h4>EVERGREEN HEDGES.</h4>

<p>These always make two growths in the season, and
the best time to perform the clipping or dressing of
them is before the plants begin their second growth.
Choose if possible dull and cloudy days for the operation.
The general practice in forming these, is to have
the sides even, and the top level, forming a right angle
on each side. However neat in appearance this may
be considered, it certainly is stiff and formal. We
never approve of shearing where it can be avoided,
and when adopted, nature ought to be imitated. We
consider that all hedges and edgings ought to be narrowed
at the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>


<h4>CARNATIONS AND PINKS.</h4>

<p>If layed about the end of June, and been properly
attended, they will by the end of this month be well
rotted and fit for transplanting. Clear away the earth
lightly, and cut them clean off from the parent plant,
nearer the stool than the original slit. Raise them
neatly out of the earth, with as many of the root-fibres
as possible; cut off the naked part of the stem close to
the fibrous roots, and trim away the straggling leaves.
Plant the finest sorts in four inch pots, and those more
common three plants in five inch pots, in the form of a
triangle, which can be separated in spring to plant in
the garden. Any of the principal stools should be (if
in the ground) lifted and put into seven inch pots to
be preserved: the others may be allowed to stand
through the winter, covering them with a few dry
leaves. Keep them in the shade a few weeks, when
they may be fully exposed. Give gentle and frequent
sprinklings of water until they have taken fresh root;
or if in want of pots, mark out a bed that can be covered
with a frame, preparing the soil therein properly.
Plant them from four to six inches apart. Shade them
from the sun until they begin to grow, giving sprinklings
of water over the foliage every evening.</p>


<h4>BULBOUS ROOTS.</h4>

<p>Look over the bulbs that are out of the ground, and
examine those that require planting. <i>Fritill&agrave;ria</i>, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
twenty species, but few of them generally cultivated,
except <i>F. imperi&agrave;lis</i>, Crown Imperial; and <i>F. p&eacute;rsica</i>.
These will require planting, and ought not to be lifted
oftener than every third year. There are four or five
varieties of the above, showy flowers, and singular in
appearance. They require a deep rich loamy soil, and
if in beds, plant them from three to four inches deep,
and one foot apart. They will grow under shade of
trees, or any situation where the soil is adapted for
them. No imbricated or scaly bulb ought to be retained
long out of the ground. When any of these are
lifted, and the young bulbs taken off, they should be
planted at once. See particularly on bulbous roots in
general next month.</p>


<h4>SOWING SEEDS OF BULBOUS ROOTS.</h4>

<p>Where any seeds of these are saved, with the intention
of sowing, let it be done this month. Procure
boxes about seven inches deep, and in size proportioned
to the quantity to be sown. Put five inches of light
sandy soil in the box, level it smoothly, and sow the
seeds separately and thickly; cover with half an inch
of light sandy loam, with a portion of earth from the
woods. Keep the box or boxes in a sheltered situation,
giving frequent sprinklings of water to keep the earth
damp, which must be protected with a frame, or covered
with leaves during winter. The plants will appear
in spring, and must be watered and kept in the
shade: when the leaves decay in June, put one inch
more soil upon them, and the second year they can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
planted with the small offsets in the garden, and treated
as other bulbs. They must be carefully marked
every year. Tulips require many years of trial before
their qualities are known; and a poor soil is best
to produce their characters after the first bloom.</p>


<h4>SOWING AND SAVING SEEDS.</h4>

<p>About the end of this month or first of next, is an
advisable period to sow seed of <i>Delph&iacute;num Aj&aacute;cis fl&ograve;repl&egrave;no</i>,
or Double Rocket Larkspur. This plant does
not flower in perfection except it is sown in autumn, and
grown a little above ground before winter, when a few
leaves can be lightly thrown amongst them, but not to
cover them entirely, as that would cause damp, and they
would rot off. <i>Core&oacute;psis tinct&ograve;ria</i>, which is now <i>Calli&oacute;psis
tinct&ograve;ria</i>, and a beautiful plant, should likewise be sown.
Be attentive in saving all kinds of seeds, many of which
will keep best in the capsule. Name them all correctly,
and with the year in which they were grown.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Rooms6" id="Rooms6"><span class="antiqua">Rooms.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>AUGUST.</i></h3>

<p>For the kinds of plants that require potting, we refer
to the Green-house for this month. All that are therein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
specified are peculiarly adapted for rooms, and we
would call attention to the genus <i>Cyclamen</i>, which
has not been generally introduced into the collections
of our ladies; as, from the character and beauty of the
flowers, they are very attracting and highly deserving of
culture. Attend to the Geraniums as there directed,
and be particular in having them cut down, and repotted,
as there fully described. The <i>Oranges</i>, <i>Lemons</i>,
<i>Oleanders</i>, and <i>Myrtles</i>, that are kept in cellars or rooms,
should have the same attention in this month as directed
in the Green-house, which to repeat here would be occupying
space unnecessarily.</p>

<p><i>R&eacute;seda odor&aacute;ta</i>, or Mignonette, is one of the most fragrant
annuals. To have it in perfection, the seed should
be sown about the end of this month, or beginning of next,
into pots of fine light earth, and sprinkled with water
frequently. When it comes up the plants must be thinned
out or transplanted; the former method is preferable.
Keep them from frost during winter, and always
near the light.</p>

<p>This will equally apply to the Green-house.</p>

<h2><a name="Hot-House7" id="Hot-House7"><span class="antiqua">Hot-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>SEPTEMBER.</i></h3>


<h4>DRESSING THE PLANTS.</h4>

<p>Having last month put the house in complete order,
all that remains necessary to be attended to, is the state
of the plants and pots, which should be regularly examined,
and of those where the roots fill the soil, a little
may be taken off the top, supplying its place with fresh
earth, thereby giving what is called a top dressing.
Give each a sufficient rod that requires it, tieing the
plant neatly thereto; minutely scrutinise each for insects,
and where they are detected, have them eradicated.</p>

<p>Finally, wash all contracted foulness from off the
pots, at the same time pick off any decayed leaves;
thus all will be in perfect order to take into the house.
If any plants have been kept in the Hot-house during
summer, they must likewise go through the same operations.</p>


<h4>OF TAKING IN THE PLANTS.</h4>

<p>From the 16th to the 24th, according to the season,
is the proper time to take in the Hot-house plants. It is
preferable to have them what might be deemed a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
days too early, than have them in the slightest affected
by cold.</p>

<p>Commence by housing the largest first, and those
that stand farthest in the house, observing to place the
most tender sorts nearest the heat or warmest part of
the house. For observations on them, see <i>May</i>: in regard
to arrangement, that must be according to the
taste of the operator. We may observe that in a small
collection it is better to have them in a regular than in
a picturesque form. A dry shelf is indispensable in this
department for placing on it all herbaceous plants, such
as <i>C&aacute;nna</i>, <i>Hedychium</i>, <i>Z&iacute;ngiber</i>, <i>K&aelig;mpf&eacute;ria</i>, &amp;c. the
watering of which from this time should be gradually
suspended, that they may have their required cessation
to make them flower well. This shelf may be in any
situation; one in darkness, where other plants will not
grow, will answer perfectly well. If there is a bark
bed, do not, until the end of December, plunge any of
the pots therein.</p>


<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>The plants being now all under protection, they must
have as much air as possible admitted to them every day,
by opening the doors, front and top sashes, closing only
at night. The syringings must be continued, and care
taken that plants of a deciduous or herbaceous nature
are not over watered. <i>Alstr&oelig;m&egrave;rias</i> are apt to rot while
dormant when they are supplied with water. The tuberous
species might be kept almost dry. Some practical
men of sound science repot these plants in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
month into fresh soil, and allow them to stand till January
almost without water. We have never adopted
this method with any description of plants, but do not
doubt of its success with that genus.</p>

<p>See that the ropes and pullies of the sashes are in
good order, and fit to stand all winter.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Green-House7" id="Green-House7"><span class="antiqua">Green-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>SEPTEMBER.</i></h3>


<p>During this month every part of the Green-house
should have a thorough cleansing, which is too frequently
neglected, and many hundreds of insects left
unmolested. To preserve the wood work in good order,
give it one coat of paint every year. Repair all broken
glass, white-wash the whole interior, giving the flues
two or three coats, and cover the stages with hot-lime,
white-wash, or oil-paint; examine ropes, pullies, and
weights, finishing by washing the pavement perfectly
clean. If there have been any plants in the house during
summer, be sure after this cleansing that they are
clean also, before they are returned to their respective
situations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>


<h4>OF WATERING.</h4>

<p>The intensity of the heat being over for the season,
the heavy dews during night will prevent so much absorption
amongst the plants. They will, in general,
especially by the end of the month, require limited supplies
of water comparatively to their wants in the summer
months. Be careful amongst the <i>Geraniums</i> that
were repotted in August, not to water them until the
new soil about their roots is becoming dry. Syringing
in this month may be suspended in time of heavy dews,
but in dry nights resort to it again.</p>

<p>The herbaceous plants and those of a succulent nature
must be sparingly supplied. The large trees that
were put in new earth will require a supply only once
a week, but in such quantity as will go to the bottom of
the tubs.</p>


<h4>PREPARING FOR TAKING IN THE PLANTS.</h4>

<p>About the end of the month all the plants should be
examined and cleaned in like manner as directed for
those of the Hot-house last month, which see. From
the 1st to the 8th of October is the most proper time
to take them into the Green-house, except those of a
half hardy nature, which may stand out till the appearance
of frost. All the Geraniums that were put in the
shade after shifting, may after the 10th be fully exposed,
which will in some degree prevent them from being weak.
Turn them in such a manner as will make them grow
equally. Always endeavour to have these plants short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
and bushy, for they are unsightly otherwise, except
where a few very large specimens are desired for show.
All Myrtles and Oleanders that were headed down, if
the young shoots are too crowded, continue to thin
them out, and give regular turnings, that all the heads
may grow regularly.</p>


<h4>STOCKS AND WALL-FLOWERS,</h4>

<p>That are wanted to flower in the Green-house (where
they do remarkably well) and are in the ground, have
them carefully lifted before the end of the month, and
planted in six or seven inch pots, with light loamy soil.
Place them in the shade till they take fresh root, and
give them frequent sprinklings of water. As soon as
the foliage becomes erect, expose them to the full sun,
and treat as Green-house plants.</p>


<h4>CHRYSANTHEMUMS.</h4>

<p>These very ornamental plants blooming so late, and
at a period when there are few others in flower, one of
each variety (or two of some of the finest) should be
lifted and put in 8 inch pots, in light loamy soil, and
treated as above directed for Stocks, &amp;c. These will
flower beautifully from October to December, and when
done blooming the pots may be plunged in the garden,
or covered with any kind of litter, until spring, when
they can be divided and planted out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>


<h4>CAPE AND HOLLAND BULBS.</h4>

<p>About the end of this month is the period for all of
these that are intended for the Green-house to be
potted. We specified some of the former last month,
and will here enumerate a few others.</p>

<p><i>Bab&igrave;ana</i>, a genus of small bulbs, with pretty blue, red,
and yellow flowers. <i>B. dist&iacute;ca</i>, pale blue flowers in two
ranks. <i>B. str&iacute;cta</i>, flowers blue and white. <i>B. tubifl&ograve;ra</i>
is beautiful, colour white and red. <i>B. plic&agrave;ta</i> has sweet-scented
pale blue flowers. There are about twenty
species of them, and they grow from six to twelve inches
high. Four inch pots are sufficient for them.</p>

<p><i>Glad&igrave;olus</i>, Corn-flag, a genus of above fifty species.
There are several very showy plants amongst them,
and a few very superb. <i>G. florib&uacute;ndus</i>, large pink and
white flowers. <i>G. cardin&agrave;lis</i>, flowers superb scarlet,
spotted with white. <i>G. byzant&igrave;nus</i>, large purple flowers.
<i>G. bl&aacute;ndus</i>, flowers of a blush rose colour, and handsome.
<i>G. cuspid&agrave;tus</i>, flowers white and purple. <i>G.
psitt&aacute;cinus</i> is the most magnificent of the genus, both in
size and beauty of flower; the flowers are striped with
green, yellow, and scarlet, about four inches diameter,
in great profusion, on a stem about two feet high, and
though rare in Europe may be seen in some collections
in this country. The beauty of this genus is all centred
in the flowers; the leaves are similar to <i>Iris</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ixia</i>, a genus containing about twenty-five species of
very free-flowering bulbs. <i>I. monad&eacute;lpha</i>, flowers blush
and green. <i>I. leuc&aacute;ntha</i>, flowers large, white. <i>I. capit&agrave;ta</i>,
flowers in heads of a white and almost black co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>lour.
<i>I. c&ograve;nica</i>, flowers orange and velvet. <i>I. columell&agrave;ris</i>
is beautifully variegated with purple, blush, and
vermilion colours. The flower stems are from six to
twenty-four inches high.</p>

<p><i>Spar&aacute;xis</i>, a beautiful genus of twelve species, closely
allied to the last, but more varied in colour. <i>S. grandifl&ograve;ra
stri&agrave;ta</i> is striped with purple ground blush. <i>S. vers&iacute;color</i>,
colours crimson, dark purple, and yellow. <i>S.
anemon&aelig;fl&ograve;ra</i> is of various colours, and very similar to
<i>Anem&ograve;ne</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trit&ograve;nia</i>, a genus of about twenty-five species. Few of
them deserve culture in regard to their beauty. <i>T. croc&agrave;ta</i>
is in our collections, as <i>I. croc&agrave;ta</i>, which is amongst
the finest, and <i>T. zanthosp&igrave;la</i> has white flowers curiously
spotted with yellow.</p>

<p><i>Wats&ograve;nia</i>, a genus containing several species of showy
flowers, several of which are in our collections, under
the genus <i>Glad&iacute;olus</i>, but the most of the species may easily
be distinguished from it by their flat shell formed
bulbs. <i>W. iridif&ograve;lia</i> is the largest of the genus, and has
flowers of a flesh colour. <i>W. r&ograve;sea</i> is large growing, the
flowers are pink, and on the stem in a pyramid form. <i>W.
humilis</i> is a pretty red flowering species. <i>W. f&uacute;lgida</i>, once
<i>Antholyza f&uacute;lgens</i>, has fine bright scarlet flowers. <i>W.
r&ugrave;bens</i> is an esteemed red flowering species, but scarce.</p>

<p>These six genera are in general cultivation. There
are several of others of merit that our limits will not admit
of inserting. We have no doubt there are some
splendid species that have not come under our observation,
and others which may be obtained from the Cape
of Good Hope not known in any collection. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
hundreds of superb bulbs indigenous to that country,
and of the same nature and habit of the above, have
not been seen in collections. The flowers of those
which we have specified are from one to four inches in
diameter, ringent, tubular, or campanulate. Pots from
four to seven inches diameter, according to the size of
the roots, will be large enough. Give them very little
water until they begin to grow; then supply moderately,
and keep them near the light. Of the Holland or
Dutch bulbs, the <i>Hyacinth</i> is the favourite to bloom in
the Green-house. A few of the <i>Tulip</i>, <i>Narcissus</i>, <i>Iris</i>, and
<i>Crocus</i>, may for variety be also planted with any other
that curiosity may dictate. When these are grown in
pots, the soil should be four-eighths loam, two-eighths
leaf mould, one-eighth decomposed manure, one-eighth
sand, well compounded; plant in pots from four to seven
inches, keep the crown of the bulb above the surface
of the soil, except of the Tulip, which should be
covered two inches. When these roots are potted,
plunge them in the garden about three inches under
ground; mark out a space sufficient to contain them;
throw out the earth about four inches deep, place the
pots therein, covering them with earth to the above
depth, making it in the form of a bed. Leave a trench
all round to carry off the rain. By so doing, the bulbs
will root strong, the soil will be kept in a congenial
state about them, and they will prove far superior than
if done in the common method. Lift them from this
bed on the approach of frost, or not later than the
second week of December, wash the pots and take
them to the Green-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>


<h4>OF REPOTTING.</h4>

<p><i>Vib&uacute;rnum.</i> This is a good period to repot all the
flowering plants of this genus. For a full description
of them, see <i>Green-house</i>, <i>March</i>. The repotting is
only intended for young plants that are wanted to
grow freely. When the <i>V. t&igrave;nus</i> is much encouraged,
it does not flower profusely.</p>

<p><i>L&igrave;lium</i>, Lily. There are four species of this splendid
genus kept in the Green-house. It has always
been our practice to repot them when they begin to
grow, though it is said by some that, when removed
at that time, they will not flower perfectly. They will
not do to be kept above a few weeks out of the
ground, and we think they ought never to be kept out
any period. We place them here, that a choice may
be made by the cultivator of either of the periods,
which is not material; observing in either case, that
excess of moisture is injurious while they are dormant.
<i>L. longifl&ograve;rum</i> grows about one foot high, with one or
more flowers. <i>L. longifl&ograve;rum suav&egrave;olens</i>, is sweet-scented,
and has only one flower. <i>L. jap&ograve;nicum</i> is the most
magnificent, grows about two feet high, with three or
more flowers on one stem. <i>L. lancif&ograve;lium</i>; we incline
to class this with <i>L. speci&ograve;sum</i>, there being no apparent
distinction in any character. The flowers are all of
the purest white. They require from five to seven
inch pots.</p>

<h2><a name="Flower_Garden6" id="Flower_Garden6"><span class="antiqua">Flower Garden.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>SEPTEMBER.</i></h3>


<h4>OF DAHLIAS.</h4>

<p>See that all these plants are supported with proper
stakes, rods, &amp;c., that the wind may have no effect in
breaking down or otherwise destroying the flower
stems. Strictly observe their respective heights and
colours, that they may be duly disposed and interspersed
next year, if not done so this. If the early
part of the month is dry, give them liberal supplies of
water.</p>


<h4>GENERAL CARE OF PLANTS IN POTS.</h4>

<p>All the flowers that are in pots, and intended to be
kept in frames during winter, should have a top-dressing,
and a general preparation for their winter quarters,
by tieing up, &amp;c. The carnation and pink layers that
were lifted and potted last month must be brought
from the shade as soon as they begin to grow; and
those that are not lifted, have them done forthwith,
that they may be rooted afresh before the frost sets in.
All Wall-flowers and Stocks should be lifted this
month, and planted in five to seven inch pots, and
treated as directed for carnation layers last month,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
until they begin to grow, when they must be fully exposed.</p>


<h4>PREPARE BEDS AND BORDERS FOR BULBOUS ROOTS.</h4>

<p>Bulbous roots of every character delight in deep
free soil; consequently, wherever they are desired to be
planted, due attention must be paid to put the soil in
proper order, to have them in perfection. Where
there are a quantity intended to be planted, to have
them in beds is the general and preferable method.
These ought to be dug from eighteen inches to two
feet deep, at the bottom of which place three or four
inches of decayed manure. Where the soil is poor it
should be enriched with well decomposed manure and
earth from the woods, incorporating both well with
the soil, breaking it all fine. This being done, allow
it to stand until the middle of next month, which see
for farther directions.</p>


<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>Tie up carefully all the <i>Chrys&aacute;nthemums</i>, <i>Tuberoses</i>,
&amp;c. Clear away the stems or haulm of any decayed
annuals or herbaceous plants, that nothing unsightly
may appear. Be attentive to the collecting of all kinds
of seeds.</p>

<h3><i>SEPTEMBER.</i></h3>


<p>Where there is a quantity of plants to be kept in
these apartments, they should be disposed to the best
effect, and at the same time in such a manner as will
be most effectual to their preservation. A stage of
some description is certainly the best, and, of whatever
shape or form, it ought to be on castors, that it
may, in severe nights of frost, be drawn to the centre
of the room. The shape may be either concave, a
half circle, or one square side. The bottom step or
table should be six inches apart, keeping each successive
step one inch farther apart, to the desired height,
which may be about six feet. Allowing the first step
to be about two feet from the floor, there will be five
or six steps, which will hold about fifty pots of a common
size. A stage in the form of half a circle will hold
more, look the handsomest, and be most convenient.
We have seen them circular, and when filled appeared
like a pyramid. These do very well, but they must be
turned every day, or the plants will not grow regularly.
With this attention it is decidedly the best. Green is
the most suitable colour to paint them.</p>

<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>The directions given for the Green-house this month
are equally applicable here. The <i>Tasseled White Chrysanthemum</i>,
and a few other late blooming sorts, are
particularly adapted for rooms. If there is no convenience
to plunge the pots with Dutch bulbs in the garden,
as described in the Green-house of this month,
give them very little water until they begin to grow.</p>

<h3><i>OCTOBER.</i></h3>


<p>Very few directions remain to be given to the department
of the Hot-house. The supplies of water for
this and the two preceding months are, according to
the state and nature of tropical plants, more limited
than at any other period of the year. This is the first
month of what may be called their dormant state. Observe
the herbaceous plants, that they are, as soon as
their foliage decays, set aside, in case of being too liberally
supplied with water. Airing is highly essential
about this period, that the plants may be gradually hardened;
but guard against injuring them. The temperature
should not be under fifty degrees; when the days
are cool, and the wind chilling, airing is not necessary;
and when air is admitted, always close up early in the
afternoon, whilst the atmosphere is warm, to supersede
the necessity of fire as long as possible. If at any time
you have recourse to it in this month, use it with great
caution.</p>

<p>Examine all the shutters and fastenings, and see that
they are in good substantial order, and where deficient
repair them instantly, that they may be in readiness.
Remove all leaves, and give syringings twice a week.
Clear off, sweep out, and wash clean, that every part
may be in the neatest order.</p>

<h3><i>OCTOBER.</i></h3>


<h4>OF TAKING IN AND ARRANGING THE PLANTS.</h4>

<p>As observed in the previous month, let the housing of
Green-house plants now be attended to. Have all in
before the eighth of the month, except a few of the half
hardy sorts, which may stand until convenient. Begin
by taking in all the tallest first, such as <i>Oranges</i>, <i>Lemons</i>,
<i>Myrtles</i>, <i>Oleanders</i>, &amp;c. Limes ought to be kept in the
warmest part of the house, otherwise they will throw
their foliage. In arrangement, order is necessary to
have a good effect; and in small houses it ought to be
neat and regular, placing the tallest behind, and according
to their size graduating the others down to the
lowest in front. Dispose the different sorts in varied
order over the house, making the contrast as striking
as possible. Having the surface of the whole as even
as practicable, with a few of the most conspicuous for
shape and beauty protruding above the mass, which
will much improve the general appearance, and greatly
add to the effect. All succulents should be put together.
They will do in a dark part of the house, where other
plants would not grow, studying to have the most tender
kinds in the warmest part, and giving gentle waterings
every three or four weeks. When all are arranged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
give them a proper syringing, after which wipe clean all
the stages, <i>benches</i>, &amp;c. sweeping out all litter, and wash
clean the pavement, which will give to all a neat and
becoming appearance.</p>

<p>Let the waterings now be done in the mornings, as
often and in such quantities as will supply their respective
wants, examining the plants every day.</p>

<p>During the continuance of mild weather, the circulation
of air must be as free as possible, opening the
doors and front and top sashes regularly over the
house. But observe in frosty nights, and wet, cloudy
weather, to keep all close shut. Be attentive in clearing
off decayed leaves and insects.</p>

<p>Any plants of <i>Lagerstr&aelig;mia</i>, <i>Sterc&ugrave;lia</i>, <i>Hydr&aacute;ngea</i>,
<i>Pomegranate</i>, and others equally hardy, that are deciduous,
may be kept perfectly in a dry, light, airy cellar,
giving frequent admissions of air.</p>


<h4>OF REPOTTING.</h4>

<p><i>Anem&ograve;nes.</i> Where <i>A. nemor&ograve;sa fl&ograve;re pl&egrave;no</i> and <i>A. thalictr&ograve;ides
fl&ograve;re pl&egrave;no</i> are kept in pots in the Green-house,
they should be turned out of the old earth, and planted
in fresh soil. They are both pretty, low growing,
double white flowering plants, and require a shaded
situation. The latter is now called <i>Thal&iacute;ctrum anemono&iacute;des</i>.</p>

<p><i>D&aacute;phne</i>, is a genus of diminutive shrubs, mostly evergreens,
of great beauty and fragrance. Very few
species of them are in our collections. <i>D. od&ograve;ra</i>, frequently
called <i>D. &iacute;ndica</i>, is an esteemed plant for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
delightful odour of its flowers, and valuable for the
period of its flowering, being from December to March,
according to the situation; leaves scattered, oblong,
lanceolate, smooth; flowers small, white, in many-flowered
terminale heads. <i>D. hybrida</i> is a species in
high estimation at present in Europe, but little known
here, being only in a few collections; flowers rose-coloured,
in terminale heads, and lateral bunches in great
profusion, and very similar to the former in habit and
shape of flower; blooms from January to May, and is
of a peculiar fragrance. <i>D. oleo&iacute;des</i> is what may be
termed "ever-blooming;" flowers of a lilac colour;
leaves elliptic, lanceolate, smooth. <i>D. laur&egrave;ola</i>, Spurge
laurel; <i>D. p&oacute;ntica</i>, <i>D. alp&igrave;na</i>, and <i>D. Cne&ograve;rum</i>, are all
fine species, and in Europe are esteemed ornaments
in the shrubbery, but we are not certain if they will
prove hardy in our vicinity.</p>

<p><i>Pr&iacute;mula.</i> There are a few fine species and varieties
in this genus, adapted either for the Green-house
or Rooms. All the species and varieties will
keep perfectly well in a frame, except the China sorts.
Having previously observed a few of the other species
and varieties, we will observe the treatment of these.
<i>P. sin&eacute;nsis</i>, now <i>pr&aelig;nitens</i>, known commonly as China
Primrose; flowers pink, and in large proliferous umbels,
flowering almost through the whole year, but
most profusely from January to May. Keep them in
the shade, and be careful that they are not over-watered
during summer. As the stems of the plant become
naked, at this repotting a few inches should be taken
off the bottom of the ball, and placing them in a larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
pot will allow the stems to be covered up to the leaves.
<i>P. p. albifl&ograve;ra</i>, colour pure white and beautiful. <i>P. p.
dentifl&ograve;ra</i>. There is also a white variety of this, both
similar to the two former, only the flower indented. All
these require the same treatment. As they only live a
few years, many individuals, to propagate them, divide
the stems, which in most cases will utterly destroy them.
The best, and we may say the only method to increase
them, is from seed, which they produce in abundance
every year.</p>

<p><i>P&aelig;onia</i>, is a magnificent genus. There are four varieties
of them, half hardy and half shrubby. They will
bear the winter if well protected, but are better in the
Green-house. These are <i>P. mout&aacute;n</i>, Tree P&aelig;ony; the
flower is about four inches in diameter, of a blush colour,
and semi-double; <i>P. M. B&agrave;nksii</i> is the common
Tree P&aelig;ony, and called in our collection <i>P. Mout&agrave;n</i>;
it has a very large double blush flower, and is much
admired. <i>P. M. papaver&agrave;cea</i> is a most magnificent variety;
has large double white flowers, with pink centres;
<i>P. M. r&ograve;sea</i> is a splendid rose-coloured double
variety, and is scarce. These plants ought not to be
exposed to the sun while in flower, as the colours become
degenerated, and premature decay follows.</p>

<p>If the Dutch bulbs intended for flowering during winter
are not potted, have them all done as soon as possible,
according to directions given last month.</p>


<h4>CAMELLIAS.</h4>

<p>These plants ought to have a thorough examination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
and those that were omitted in repotting before they
commenced growing, may be done in the early part of
this month; but it is not adviseable, except the roots
are matted round the ball of earth, which should be
turned out entire. Examine all the pots, stir up the
surface of the earth, and take it out to the roots, supplying
its place with fresh soil. Destroy any worms
that may be in the pots, as they are very destructive to
the fibres. Look over the foliage and with a sponge and
water clear it of all dust, &amp;c. Frequently the buds are
too crowded on these plants, especially the <i>Double white</i>
and <i>Variegated</i>. In such case pick off the weakest, and
where there are two together, be careful in cutting, so
that the remaining bud may not be injured.</p>

<p>This is the best period of the year to make selections
of these, as they now can be transported hundreds of
miles without any material injury, if they are judiciously
packed in close boxes. In making a choice of these,
keep in view to have distinctly marked varieties, including
a few of those that are esteemed as stocks for
producing new kinds, which are undoubtedly indispensable;
and will reward the cultivator in a few years
with new sorts. Besides, it will afford unbounded gratification
to behold any of these universally admired
ornaments of the Green-house improving by our assistance
and under our immediate observation. There
is nothing to prevent any individual from producing
splendid varieties in a few years. Mr. Hogg correctly
observes, "It is very probable in a few years we shall
have as great a variety of Camellias, as there are of
Tulips, Hyacinths, Carnations, Auriculas, &amp;c."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been often said that these plants are difficult
of cultivation. This is unfounded, indeed they are the
reverse if put in a soil congenial to their nature. When
highly manured soils are given, which are poisonous to
the plants, sickness or death will inevitably ensue; but
this cannot be attributed to the delicacy of their nature.
We can unhesitatingly say there is no Green-house
plant more hardy or easier of cultivation, and they are
equally so in the parlour, if not kept confined in a room
where there is a continuance of drying fire heat, their
constitution not agreeing with an arid atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Flower-Garden.</h2>

<h3><i>OCTOBER.</i></h3>


<h4>OF PLANTING VARIOUS BULBOUS FLOWER ROOTS.</h4>

<p>From the middle of October to the beginning of November
is the best period for a general planting of
Dutch bulbs.</p>

<p><i>Cr&ograve;cuses</i> are the earliest in flower, and may be planted
about six inches off the edgings, about four inches
apart and two deep, or in beds four feet wide; the varieties
selected and planted across the bed in rows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
distinct colours, they flowering so early, and in that
manner have a grand effect. There are above sixty
varieties to be had.</p>

<p><i>Hyacinths.</i> The ground that was prepared for these
last month, should be all divided into beds four feet
wide, leaving between each alleys of twenty inches.
Skim off three inches of the surface of the former into
the latter, level the bed smoothly with the rake, and
mark it off in rows eight inches apart. Plant the roots
in the row eight inches asunder. Thus they will be
squares of eight inches, and by planting the different
colours alternately the bed will be beautifully diversified.
Press each root gently down with the hand, that
in covering up they may not be displaced. Put about
four inches of earth over the crowns, which will make
the beds from two to three inches higher than the alleys.
The beds before and after planting should be gently
rounded from the middle to each side to let the rain
pass off. Finish all by raking evenly, straighten the
edgings with the line, and clear out the alleys or pathways.</p>

<p><i>Tulips</i> like a lighter and richer earth than Hyacinths.
Prepare the beds in the same manner, and so as the
roots will stand nine inches apart each way; cover
them five inches deep, as the new bulbs are produced
above the old.</p>

<p>If it is intended to screen either of these while in
flower, the beds should be made wider. Where two beds
are to be shaded under one awning, make the alleys
alternately two or three feet wide; the one two feet
wide to be under the awning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Polyanthus and Italian Narcissus</i>, may be planted in
every respect as <i>Hyacinths</i>, only they require a lighter
and richer soil.</p>

<p><i>Jonquils.</i> Plant these in the same soil as <i>Tulips</i>, six
inches apart, and cover three inches deep. They do
not flower so well the first year as in the second and
third, therefore should only be lifted every third year.</p>

<p><i>Anemones and Ranunculuses.</i> These roots like a fresh
rich, well pulverized, loamy soil. In light sandy soils
they will languish in early droughts, and sometimes do
not show their flowers fully. Cow manure is the best
to use for enriching the soil. The whole should be
well mixed and incorporated to the depth of eighteen
or twenty inches. The roots may be planted in four-foot
beds, or in such a manner as a low frame of
boards can be placed over them, when the winter sets
in very severe. If intended to be shaded while in
flower, leave a sufficiency of space in the alleys as directed
for Tulips and Hyacinths. Do not raise the
beds above one inch higher than the alleys, and form
the surface level, in order to detain rather than throw
off moisture. Then draw drills exactly two inches
deep and six inches apart across the bed. In these
place the roots, claws down, about four inches distant
from each other. The roots of the Anemones
are flat, and the side on which there are small protuberances,
is that from which the stems proceed. Press
each root a little down with the hand, and cover all
carefully so as not to displace them. Smooth the surface
with the rake, leaving the bed quite level.</p>

<p>Many other bulbous flowers might be added to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
above; but as their culture is so similar, it would be
superfluous to say more of them. They should be allowed
space and depth according to the size of the
bulb; a covering of two inches for the smallest, and
five for the largest, will generally answer, and the intermediate
roots in proportion. We will enumerate a
few of the different kinds, <i>Starch</i> and <i>Musk Hyacinths</i>;
of <i>Narcissus</i>, the <i>Paper</i>, <i>Grand Monarque</i>, and <i>Nodding</i>,
with the two previously mentioned, are the most profuse
in flower. Some of them will have above twelve flowers
on one stem. Of <i>Lilies</i>, all the varieties of <i>M&aacute;rtagon</i>,
<i>Tigr&igrave;num</i> and <i>Chalced&oacute;nicum</i>, with our native species and
varieties. Of <i>Iris</i>, <i>Lusit&aacute;nica</i>, two varieties, yellow and
blue; <i>Xiphio&iacute;des</i>, or <i>Ziphio&iacute;des</i>; and <i>P&eacute;rsica</i>, are the
finest of the bulbous sorts. Snow-drop with several
other minor bulbs.</p>

<p>All of these flowering bulbs may be advantageously
planted in patches through the garden by taking out
about one square foot of earth. Break it well, and if
poor enrich it. Plant four bulbs in each of the same
colour, and the clumps that are contiguous to contain
different colours.</p>


<h4>PLANTING AND TRANSPLANTING.</h4>

<p>This is a very proper period to plant the beautiful
and early flowering <i>Pyrus jap&oacute;nica</i>, now called <i>Cyd&oacute;nia
jap&oacute;nica</i>. The blossoms are of a rich scarlet colour.
It is the earliest flowering shrub of the garden, and deciduous,
though said by some to be "an evergreen."
The plant is bushy, and well adapted for single plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
in grass plats, or forming low ornamental hedges. There
is likewise <i>C. j. &aacute;lba</i>, a fine white variety of the same
habit, and both are of the hardiest nature&mdash;also for the
various species of <i>Anem&ograve;nes</i> and all the herbaceous
<i>P&aelig;onias</i>.</p>

<p>Of the latter there are above nineteen species and
twenty-two varieties, a few of which are particularly
esteemed, and exceedingly handsome. <i>P. &egrave;dulis whitl&iacute;ji</i>
is a splendid large double <i>P &egrave;dulis</i> white; <i>P. H&ugrave;mei</i> is
a beautiful large double dark blush; <i>P. &egrave;dulis fr&agrave;grans</i>
is a fine large double scarlet, rose-scented variety.
These three plants ought to be in every garden.
The flowers are full in the centre, and frequently
above six inches in diameter; <i>P. &aacute;lba chin&egrave;nsis</i> is said
to be the largest and finest of the herbaceous sorts;
colour pure white, with pink at the bottom of the
petals&mdash;it is a scarce variety; <i>P. parad&oacute;xa fimb&agrave;tria</i>,
fringed double red, and esteemed; <i>P. officin&aacute;lis r&uacute;bra</i> is
the common double red. There are several other very
fine single species and varieties, the flowers of which
are principally red or blush, but none so magnificent as
the above mentioned. This is perhaps a more favourable
period to plant <i>Dodec&aacute;theon</i> than March; for its
character see that month of this department. <i>Ascl&egrave;pias
tuber&ograve;sa</i> should now be planted.</p>

<p><i>Double Primroses</i>, <i>Polyanthus</i>, <i>Daisies</i>, &amp;c. Any of
these that were planted in shaded situations in spring,
and have been preserved through the summer, should
have for their farther protection a bed well sheltered
from the north west, in which they should be planted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
four inches apart. Give them a few sprinklings of water
in the morning, and have a temporary frame of
rough boards put together to place over them during
the severity of winter. The frame may be covered
with the same in place of glass, which must be kept
over them while they are in a frozen state.</p>

<p>Any other plants that are in the ground, which are
intended to be protected with frames through the winter,
ought to be immediately lifted and potted; and
treated as directed for all new potted plants.</p>


<h4>GRASS AND GRAVEL WALKS.</h4>

<p>The former should be trimly cut and well rolled this
month, that they may appear neat all winter. Never
allow decayed leaves to lay any time upon them, as
they are apt to rot out the grass. The latter should
be divested of every weed, and receive a firm rolling.
Clear them at all times of leaves and other litter.
These, if on a declivity, and have not a firm substantial
bottom, will be subject to be cut up with every heavy
rain. A break should be put in every twenty, forty, or
eighty feet, to throw off the water. A strong plank
will answer perfectly well, but in such situations we
would prefer grass-walks.</p>


<h4>PLANTING EVERGREENS.</h4>

<p>This month is the best period in autumn to plant
these shrubs, and where there is a great extent to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
planted it would be advisable to do a part of it now;
but we give the preference to April, which see for directions.</p>


<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>When the plantings of bulbs, &amp;c. are finished, every
part of the garden should have a thorough cleaning.
All annual flowers will have passed the season of their
beauty; therefore, remove the decayed flower stems or
haulm, and trim off the borders. Dig all vacant ground,
especially that intended to be planted with shrubs in
the ensuing spring, which ought to be dug from one to
two feet deep. Roses delight in a deep light soil.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="Rooms8" id="Rooms8"><span class="antiqua">Rooms.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>OCTOBER.</i></h3>


<p>Have a stage or stages, as described last month, in
the situations where they are intended to remain all winter;
place the plants on them from the first to the eighth
of this month, beginning with the tallest on the top, graduating
to the bottom. It is desirable to place flats or
saucers under each, to prevent the water from falling
to the floor, and the water should be emptied from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
flats of all except those of <i>C&aacute;lla</i> and <i>Hydr&aacute;ngea</i>. The
latter while dormant should be kept only a little moist.</p>

<p>Previous to taking in the plants, they should be divested
of every decayed leaf, insects, and all contracted
dust, having their shoots neatly tied up, and every one
in correct order. Every leaf of the <i>Cam&eacute;llias</i> ought to
be sponged, and the plants placed in a cool airy exposure,
shaded from the direct rays of the sun. If the
flower buds are too crowded, picking off the weakest
will preserve the remainder in greater perfection, and
prevent them in part from falling off. Do not on any
occasion keep them in a room where there is much
fire heat, as the flower buds will not expand in an arid
atmosphere. See Green-house this month more largely
on this subject.</p>


<h4>OF BULBOUS ROOTS.</h4>

<p>Those that are intended to flower in glasses, should
be placed therein this month and kept in a cool room.
After the fibres begin to push a few shoots, the glasses
may be taken to the warmest apartments to cause them
to flower early. Bring a few from the coldest to the
warmest every two weeks, and thus a succession of
bloom may be kept up from January to March. Where
the roots intended for pots are still out of the ground,
the sooner they are planted the better. (See last month
for directions.)</p>

<p><i>Cape Bulbs.</i> All that are unplanted and offering to
grow, should be put in pots forthwith. Ample direc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>tions
are given for the planting of these in the two preceding
months.</p>

<p>Repot <i>R&ugrave;bus ros&aelig;f&ograve;lius</i>, or Bramble-rose. They
should have pots one size larger than those they are
now in. To make them flower profusely, when done
blooming in May, divide them and put only a few stems
in one pot, and repot them in this month, as above
directed.</p>


<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>Any herbaceous plants in the collection ought to be
set aside, and the water in part withheld. When the
stems and foliage are decayed, the plants may be put
in a cool cellar, where they will not be in danger of
frost, and be permitted to remain there until they
begin to grow; then bring them to the light, and treat
as directed for these kinds of plants. Deciduous
plants may be treated in a similar manner.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="Hot-House9" id="Hot-House9"><span class="antiqua">Hot-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>NOVEMBER.</i></h3>


<p>The essential points to be attended to in the Hot-house
during this month, are <i>fire</i>, <i>air</i>, and <i>water</i>. The
former must be applied according to the weather, observing
not to allow the temperature to be under fifty degrees,
and it ought not to continue long at that degree;
fifty-two degrees being preferable. The shutters should
be on every night when there is any appearance of frost,
and taken off early in the morning. Admit air in small
portions every day that the sun has any effect, and the
atmosphere mild, observing that the temperature of the
house be above sixty degrees previous to admission.
Shut all close early in the afternoon or when any sudden
changes occur.</p>


<h4>OF A CISTERN AND WATER.</h4>

<p>In watering it is important to have the water of the
same temperature in this department as the roots of
the plants. To have this there are two kinds of cisterns,
or tanks, that might be adopted; one may be
sunk in the house under ground, either closely plastered,
or lined with lead, and neatly covered up, having a
small perpendicular pump therein, or placed so that the
water could be lifted by hand. The other might, where
convenience will admit, be placed over the furnace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
either in the back shed, or inside of the house, and the
water could be drawn off this by a stop-cock. These
can be supplied in part with rain water by having
spouts round the house to lead into the cisterns, supplying
any deficiency from the pump. Thus water of
a congenial temperature may always be at hand, which
is of great importance to the healthful constitution of
the plants. The water must now be given in moderate
portions, examining the plants every day. Be careful
in watering bulbs, as the smallest supply is sufficient for
them at present. Succulents will require a little every
two weeks, except they are over the flues, when they
may have some every week.</p>

<p>Constantly clear off all decayed leaves, and carry
them out of the house, which sweep and wash clean,
and keep all in the neatest order.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h3><i>NOVEMBER.</i></h3>


<h4>OF AIR AND WATER.</h4>

<p>Airing the house should be strictly attended to.
Every day that there is no frost it may be admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
largely, and in time of slight frosts in smaller portions,
never keeping it altogether close when the sun has any
effect on the interior temperature of the house, which
should not be allowed to be higher than fifty degrees.</p>

<p>Water must be given in a very sparing manner. None
of the plants are in an active state of vegetation, consequently
it will be found that looking over them twice
a week and supplying their wants will be sufficient.
Succulents will need a little once in three weeks or a
month. Give very moderate supplies to the <i>Amaryllis</i>
that are dormant, and keep all of these bulbs in the
warmest part of the house.</p>


<h4>OF TENDER BULBS.</h4>

<p>Where there are tropical bulbs in the collection, and
there is not the convenience of a Hot-house; they may
be very well preserved by shaking them clear of the
soil. Dry them properly, and place them in a box
of very dry sand, or moss, which also must be perfectly
dry, and put them in a situation where they will be
clear of frost, and free from damp. These can be
potted about the first of April. Give no water till they
begin to grow, then plant them in the garden about
the middle of May, when they will flower during the
summer season, if their age will permit.</p>


<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>If there are any of the half hardy plants exposed,
have them taken into the house, or under the requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
protection, in frames, pits, cellars, &amp;c. The autumn
flowering Cape bulbs should be placed near the glass,
and free from the shade of other plants. Cleanliness
through the whole house and amongst the plants ought
at all times to be attended to.</p>

<h2><a name="Flower-Garden1" id="Flower-Garden1"><span class="antiqua">Flower-Garden.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>NOVEMBER.</i></h3>


<p>Wherever there are any Holland bulbs remaining
unplanted, have them put in as soon as possible, lest
frost should set in. It is not advisable to keep them
later out of the ground than the beginning of this
month.</p>


<h4>PROTECTION OF CHOICE BULBS.</h4>

<p>On the appearance of the severity of winter, the finer
sorts of these should have a simple protection, not because
they will not do without such care, but to prevent
the alternate thawing and freezing of the embryo
of the bulb. To give them a covering three inches deep
of any of the following substances, will do perfectly
well,&mdash;saw-dust not resinous, old tan bark, half decayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
leaves, or very rotten manure. The last is preferable,
as it would in part enrich the soil.</p>

<p><i>Anem&ograve;nes</i> and <i>Ranunculus</i> ought to be protected by a
frame; the foliage being above ground, none of the
above will answer. It is not necessary that the frame
should be covered with glass, close boards will answer
perfectly, which must not be over them except during
frost.</p>


<h4>TUBEROSES, DAHLIAS, TIGRIDIAS, AND AMARYLLIS.</h4>

<p>These tubers and bulbs, as soon as the frost has
partly injured the foliage, should be taken up, and dried
thoroughly, either in the sun or a room where there
is fire heat, taking care at all times to keep them clear
from frost. When they are dry, divest them of their
foliage and fibres. When perfectly dry, pack them in
boxes with dry sand, or moss. Store these away for
the winter, either in a warm room or a dry cellar,
where they will at all times be exempt from frost, the
least touch of which would destroy them. We have
kept them completely secure in the cellar.</p>


<h4>ERYTHRINAS.</h4>

<p>Where there are any plants of <i>E. herb&agrave;cea</i>, <i>E. laurif&ograve;lia</i>,
or <i>E. cr&iacute;sta-g&aacute;lla</i>, which are intended to be lifted,
they should be carefully done and preserved in half dry
earth, and kept beside the <i>D&aacute;hlias</i>. We are not sure
of the former agreeing with this treatment, but certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
of the others, which are magnificent ornaments in the
Flower-garden.</p>


<h4>PRIMROSES, POLYANTHUS, AND DAISIES,</h4>

<p>That were planted in a sheltered spot, as directed
last month, should have a frame placed over them, and
their covering in readiness for the approach of winter;
giving the plants a light covering of leaves, which will
preserve their foliage from the effects of frost.</p>


<h4>CHOICE CARNATIONS, PINKS, AND AURICULAS,</h4>

<p>That are in pots, should be placed in the frame intended
for their abode during winter. If the pots are
plunged to the rims in tan, half decayed leaves, or saw
dust, it will greatly protect their roots from the severe
effects of frost. Where glass is used for these frames,
they should have besides a covering of boards, or straw
mats; those that are in beds may be covered as above
directed for Primroses, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They ought not to be uncovered while in a frozen
state. It is not altogether the intensity of cold that
destroys these plants so much as the alternate thawing
and freezing.</p>

<p>All half hardy plants, such as <i>Wall-flower</i>, <i>German
stocks</i>, <i>Sweet-bay</i>, tender roses, with several others, should
be protected as above directed for Carnations. Earth
or tan should be put round the outside of these frames,
which will be a partial shelter from the changing state
of the atmosphere. Oak leaves answer the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
very well, but they are a harbour for all kinds of vermin,
especially rats and mice, which would destroy every
thing. It may be useful to say a few words on the nature
of tan or tanner's bark. Many suppose that the
smallest quantity will produce heat, If three or four
cart loads of it are put into one heap, and protected
from the rain, it will ferment; and when the first fermentation
is abated, by mixing it with leaves, a substantial
hot-bed may be made. Or put it by itself into
a pit, and where there is no pit, boards may be substituted
to keep it together; either of these methods will
produce a lasting heat. But in small quantities and
exposed to rain, &amp;c. no heat will be produced, but rather
the contrary. It is excellent when dry in keeping out
frost from any plants, being a body not easily penetrated,
similar to dry sand, saw-dust, or dry leaves. Frequently
the same opinion is held in regard to stable
manure, small portions of which will never produce
heat.</p>


<h4>OF PROTECTING PLANTS IN THE GARDEN.</h4>

<p>During this or next month, according to the state of
the season, protect all the plants that are in the ground,
which are not completely hardy. To avoid repetition,
these will be designated in the general list. The coverings
may be straw, Russia mats, canvass, boxes or
barrels. The two latter must be perforated in the top,
to let the damp air pass off, or the plant would become
musty, or finally mortify. Those covered with straw
or mats should have small stakes placed round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
plants, and covering tied thereto, and remain so until
the month of March or first of April. Herbaceous
plants that are tender, may be covered with three or
four inches of tan, saw-dust, or half decayed leaves,
which will tend greatly to preserve their roots. These
coverings must be carefully removed on the first opening
of spring. The shrubs that are otherwise covered
would be greatly benefited by having their roots protected
in a similar manner as directed for herbaceous
plants.</p>


<h4>PROTECTION OF SEEDLING BULBS.</h4>

<p>If any seeds of <i>Hyacinths</i>, <i>Tulips</i>, <i>Fritill&agrave;ria</i>, were
sown in pots or boxes, let them be removed to a dry
sheltered situation, and plunged level with the ground;
or fill the spaces between them with dry leaves or tanner's
bark, and cover the whole with new fallen leaves,
laying over all a few boards to prevent the wind blowing
them off. These form better coverings than straw
or haulm, which is liable to become musty, and communicate
the effect to the roots. The above covering is
not required until the approach of severe frost.</p>


<h4>OF PLANTING DECIDUOUS TREES AND SHRUBS.</h4>

<p>It is not recommendable to make a general planting
of these at this period of the year; the success entirely
depending on the nature of the season and the state
of the soil. If any are planted, let them be those of
the hardiest nature, and in light and absorbent soil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
not subject to be stagnated or over-flooded during winter.
When this and next month are mild, autumn
plantings are frequently as sure as those of the spring.
But the precarious state of the seasons is not to be
depended upon, therefore avoid largo plantings of any
kind, and more especially of delicate roses, the roots
of which are apt to rot off except they have been previously
grown in pots. Nothing can be more injurious
to a plant at this season particularly, than to bed its
roots in mortar, by which the tender fibres either perish
or are cramped ever afterwards. The soil at time of
planting should be so friable as not to adhere to the
spade, which is a good rule in planting at any season,
or in any soil.</p>


<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>Carry out of the garden all decayed leaves and litter
of every description, cutting down any weeds that remain.
Collect all the stakes and rods that have been
supporting plants; tie them up in bundles for the use
of next year, and put them under cover. Look over
every part of the garden, and see that nothing has
been omitted in the way of covering or other protection.
The sashes that are to be used on the frames
should be perfectly whole, every interstice in the glass
puttied, and all ready for use when occasion may require.
Attend to all plants in pots, and give them gentle
waterings as they stand in need; but never during
the time the soil is frozen about their roots.</p>

<h3><i>NOVEMBER.</i></h3>


<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>The remarks and instructions that are given last
month for these apartments will equally answer here.
Where the Dutch bulbs were omitted to be placed in
glasses, they ought not to be longer delayed. A few
pots of those that were planted in September may be
placed in a warmer situation. If they were plunged in
the ground, the roots will be strongly fibred, and will
produce large flowers, providing the bulbs are of a good
sort.</p>

<p><i>Ox&agrave;lis.</i> The autumn flowering species will now be
in bloom, and must be kept in the sun to make them
expand freely. The neglect of this is the principal reason
that these plants do not flower perfectly in Rooms.</p>

<p><i>Cam&eacute;llias.</i> These plants, where there is a collection,
flower from this period to April; and the general desire
to be fully acquainted with the method of their
culture has induced us to be liberal in our observations
on every point and period through the various stages
of their growth and flowering. We will here only remind
the enquirer, that a pure air, a damp atmosphere,
and giving the plants frequent sprinklings, are the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>sent
necessities, which only are conducive to their perfection.</p>

<p>Attend to the turning of Geraniums and other rapid
growing plants, that all sides of them may have an
equal share of light.</p>

<h2><a name="Hot-House10" id="Hot-House10"><span class="antiqua">Hot-House.</span></a></h2>

<h3><i>DECEMBER.</i></h3>


<p>The uncertainty of the weather in this month requires
the operator to be constantly on guard, to ward off
danger, either from frost, snow, or cutting winds. The
temperature observed last month must be continued,
but not exceeded, which would cause premature vegetation,
of which the result and effects have already
been frequently observed. Always kindle the fires in
time, to prevent the heat from being lower than what
has been mentioned, lest a severe frost should take,
as then a considerable lapse ensues before the fire
has any effect, and if the wind blows high, the result
might be injurious, unless the house be very close.</p>


<h4>OF SHUTTERS.</h4>

<p>The benefit of these in severe weather is of material
service, for the preservation of an even temperature
in the house during the night, when changes are not
observed, but they ought never to remain on through
the day when the fire can be properly attended to. If
the front and the lowest sash of the roof are covered
with these, it is generally sufficient. They should be
made of half inch boards, closely grooved together,
having a cross bar in the centre, and one at each end
with one at each side, which will make them substan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>tial.
If they are frequently painted with care, they will
last many years. No snow ought to be allowed to lay
on these while they are on the glass, for reasons that
we have assigned. See <i>January</i> and <i>February</i>.</p>

<p>Some adopt double panes of glass to supersede the
use of shutters, which, they think are attended with considerable
labour, (at the most only ten minutes a day
while in use.) The sash frame is made a little deeper,
so as to allow half an inch between the panes of glass.
The one is glazed from the out and the other from the
inside. It appears to answer the purpose tolerably well,
but the glass must be both fine and even in the surface,
lest a lens should be produced, and cause a focus, which
would evidently hurt some part of the plants. We are
almost confident that we have seen this effect in some
instances. There must be a small hole about an eighth
of an inch in both ends of each row of glass to allow a
current to dry up the moisture that may arise.</p>


<h4>OF PLACING BULBS, &amp;c. IN THE HOT-HOUSE.</h4>

<p>If any <i>Hyacinths</i> or other Dutch roots are wanted to
flower early, a few of them may be put in the Hot-house
near the front glass, which will greatly tend to forward
their time of flowering. By having some brought in
every two weeks, a continued succession of bloom will
be kept up.</p>

<p><i>Calceol&agrave;rias.</i> Two or three plants of the fine blooming
kinds may be placed in this department, towards
the end of the month. Divide the roots as soon as they
begin to grow, leaving only one stem to each root,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
which put in a four inch pot, enlarging it as soon as the
roots extend to the outside of the ball, that by the month
of May they may be in seven or eight inch pots, in which
they will flower superbly. Give <i>Alstr&oelig;m&egrave;rias</i> the same
treatment.</p>


<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>If there is a tan bed in the house, and it was renewed
in September, the pots should now be plunged therein.
The violent heat will partly be over, and the plants are
not so liable to suffer at root in this as last month. It
will in part prevent the plants from being affected by
sudden changes of temperature. Be attentive in keeping
all insects completely under. This is the period
that these are most neglected, but by attending to the
modes of their destruction, as already given, no species
of them will either be hurtful or unsightly. Syringe the
plants about twice a week, and always remember that
decayed leaves or litter of any description do not beautify
healthy plants, neither do they form a part of a well
kept Hot-house.</p>

<h3><i>DECEMBER.</i></h3>


<p>The weather may probably be now severe, and it is
at all times advisable to keep the temperature as steady
and regular as possible. The thermometer should be
kept in the centre of the house, and free from the effects
of reflection. As noticed last month, sun heat
may be as high as 50&deg; in the house, and would not be
hurtful, but it should not continue so for any considerable
time without admission of air. The fire heat
should not exceed 43&deg;, and never be below 33&deg;. It
ought not to continue at that point&mdash;36&deg; is the lowest
for a continuation that with safety can be practised.
So that no error may occur, the temperature ought to
be known in the coolest and warmest part of the house,
and the variation remembered. Then whatever part
of the house the thermometer is placed, a true calculation
of the heat of the whole interior can be made.
We would recommend to the inexperienced to keep
the thermometer in the coldest part of the house. A
Green-house compactly and closely built, and the glass
all covered with shutters, (which no house ought to be
constructed without,) will seldom require artificial heat;
but by being long kept close, the damp will increase.
In such case give a little fire heat, and admit air to
purify the house. In fresh mild weather, give liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
portions of air all over the house; and though there
is a little frost, while mild, and the sun shining, the
plants will be benefited by a small portion of air for
the space of an hour, or even for half of that time.</p>

<p>Whatever state the weather may be through the
winter, never keep the house long shut up. Thirty-six
hours, or at most sixty, should be the longest time at
once; rather give a little fire heat.</p>

<p>We are no advocates for keeping plants long in
darkness, and never think that our plants are receiving
justice, if kept longer in darkness than two nights and
one day.</p>

<p>Respecting watering and other necessary operations,
see next month particularly.</p>


<h4>BULBOUS ROOTS.</h4>

<p>Those that were plunged in the garden, if not lifted
and brought under cover, should now be done without
delay. Clean the pots, and stir up the surface of the
soil. Hyacinths grow neatest by being kept very close
to the top glass; the flower stems are thereby stronger
and shorter. Water moderately until they begin to
grow freely.</p>

<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>Having in the preceding month, under this head,
given details for the protection of plants of a delicate
nature, and the forwarding of necessary work, only a few
remarks remain to be added. If there is any part therein
described omitted, have it done forthwith; every day
increases the danger of the effects of frost. If there
is a doubt of any plants not standing without protection
which are generally considered perfectly hardy,
such as <i>Champney</i>, <i>Grevillii</i>, <i>Noisette</i>, and similar
roses, tie straw or mats three or four feet up the stems
of such, which will prevent all risk.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> For valuable
plants that are on walls, and in danger of being entirely
destroyed, it is advisable to be at the expense of having
a frame made to answer them, and cover the same
with oil-cloth. The frame thus covered could be taken
off in mild weather, and replaced again when necessary,
causing very little trouble; and if properly taken care of,
would last many years. Coverings of any construction
and of the same material would answer for any part of
the garden, and are the best in our opinion that could
be adopted.</p>

<p>As the trying season is now approaching for all
plants that are kept in rooms, especially those that are
desired to have a flourishing aspect through the winter,
a few general instructions (although they may have
been previously advanced) will perhaps be desirable to
all those who are engaged in this interesting occupation,
which forms a luxury through the retired hours of
a winter season, and with very little attention many are
the beauties of vegetative nature that will be developed
to the gratification of every reflecting mind. The following
is a routine of every day culture.</p>

<p>Do not at any time admit air (except for a few moments)
while the thermometer is below 32&deg; exposed in
the shade.</p>

<p>In time of very severe frosts the plants ought to be
withdrawn from the window to the centre of the room
during night.</p>

<p>Never give water until the soil in the pots is inclining
to become dry, except for Hyacinths and other
Dutch bulbs that are in a growing state, which must
be liberally supplied.</p>

<p>Destroy all insects as soon as they appear; for means
of destruction see next month.</p>

<p>Give a little air every favourable opportunity, (that
is, when the thermometer is above 33&deg; exposed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
shade,) by putting up the window one, two or three
inches, according to the state of the weather.</p>

<p>Clean the foliage with sponge and water frequently
to remove all dust, &amp;c. The water thus used must not
exceed 96&deg; or blood-heat, but 60&deg; is preferable.</p>

<p>Turn the plants frequently to prevent them growing
to one side.</p>

<p><i>Roses</i> of the daily sort may be obtained early by having
them in a warm room, that has a south window,
and as soon as they begin to grow, admit air in small
portions about noon every day that the sun has any
effect. Such must be well supplied with water.</p>

<p><i>Cam&eacute;llias</i>, when in bud and flower, should never be
allowed to become the least dry, neither confined from
fresh air. The effects would be that the buds would
become stinted, dry, and drop off. Therefore, to have
these in perfection, attend strictly to watering. Give
frequent airings, and wash the leaves once in two weeks
with water. Never keep them above one day in a
room, where there is a strong coal fire, and not
above two days where wood is used as fuel. The
most of <i>Cam&eacute;llias</i> will bear 3&deg; of frost without the
smallest injury, so that they are easier kept than <i>Geraniums</i>,
except when they are in bloom. In that state
frost will destroy the flowers. The air of a close cellar
is destruction to the buds.</p>

<p>Bulbs in glasses must be supplied with fresh water
once a week, in which period they will inhale all the
nutritive gas that they derive from that element, if they
are in a growing state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>


<h4>ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A HOT-HOUSE.</h4>

<p>There have been many plans devised and visionary
projects offered to the public as the best for a well regulated
Hot-house. As we intend forming one for practical
purposes, we shall adopt a convenient size, have
flues for the conveyance of heat, and coal or wood for
fuel.</p>

<p><i>Site and Aspect.</i>&mdash;The house should stand on a situation
naturally dry, and if possible sheltered from the
north west, and clear from all shade on the south, east
and west, so that the sun may at all times act effectually
upon the house. The standard principle as to
aspect is to set the front directly to the south. Any
deviation from that point should incline to east.</p>

<p><i>Dimensions.</i>&mdash;The length may be from ten feet upwards;
but if beyond thirty feet, the number of fires and
flues are multiplied. The medium width is from twelve
to sixteen feet. Our directions will apply to the two
extreme points, viz. thirty feet by sixteen, and in height
at back from twelve to eighteen feet; the height in
front six feet, including about three feet in brick basement
to support the front glass, which will be two and
a half feet, allowing six inches for frame work.</p>

<p><i>Furnace and Flues.</i>&mdash;It is of great importance to have
these erected in such a manner as will effectually heat
the house. The greatest difficulty is to have the furnace
to draw well. As workmen are not generally
conversant on the subject, nor yet understand the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
or distribution of heat in these departments, we will
give minute details on their construction. The furnace
should be outside of the house, either at back or end;
the former is preferable, circumstances not always
allowing it on the other plan. Dig out the furnace hole,
or what is termed stock hole, about five feet deep. Let
the door of the furnace be in the back wall of the
house, thereby having all the heated building inside,
that no heat may be lost. The brick work round
the furnace should be from fifteen to eighteen inches
thick, laying the inside with fire-brick. The furnace
will require to be two and a half feet long, ten inches
wide, and one foot high, before the spring of the arch
and clear of the bars; leave one foot for an ash pit,
then lay the bars. They should be sixteen inches long,
one inch broad on the upper side, two inches deep, and
two eighths broad on the lower side, and with the door
and frame should be cast iron. Half an inch between
each bar will be sufficient. The flue should rise from the
furnace by a steep declivity of about two feet, and pass
the door of the house (without a dip), when it must be
elevated above the level of the floor of the house along
the front, and at the opposite end of the house must
dip to pass the door. The dip must not be lower than
the top of the furnace, and should be of a concave
form, (avoiding acute angles.) Lead it along the back
to enter the wall over the furnace. When thus taken
round the house, the heat will be expanded before it
passes off, The inside of the flues should be about six
inches wide and eight inches deep; plaster the bottom
of it, but no other part, as plaster is partially a non-con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>ductor.
The above description is for burning anthracite
coal, but where wood is to be the fuel, the furnace
and flues must be one half larger. We have been particular
in the description of furnace bars, as those generally
used are miserable substitutes. Circumstances
may cause the furnace to be placed at the end or front
of the house. In either case the stock hole will not require
to be so deep; or where there is only one door in
the house a stock hole three and a half feet deep will
be enough, which should be built like a cellar to keep
out any under water. In all instances pass the first flue
to the front of the house, over which have a close shelf
eight inches clear, covered with two inches of sand,
and by keeping it moist will afford a very congenial
heat to young valuable plants. Likewise over the furnace
have a frame in the same manner, which will be
found valuable. Any part of the furnace or flue that
is under the floor of the house, should have a vacuity on
both sides to let the heat pass upward.</p>

<p><i>Bark Pit.</i>&mdash;We consider such an erection in the
centre of a Hot-house a nuisance, and prefer a stage,
which may be constructed according to taste. It
should be made of the best Carolina pine, leaving a
passage round the whole to cause a free circulation of
air. The back and end paths should be about two
feet wide, and the front three feet. The angle of the
stage should be parallel with the glass, having the
steps from six inches to one foot apart.</p>

<p>Where there are some large plants, they may stand
on the floor behind the stage, or on tressels, according
to their height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Angle of the glazed roof.</i>&mdash;The pitch of the roof is
usually varied to agree with the design of the house,
and the size of the plants to be grown therein. Where
pleasure and ornament are the principal objects, the
angle should be about 43&deg;, but a few degrees of inclination
either way is of minor importance, the height
and elevation being regulated by the size of the plants
intended to be cultivated. It is not advisable to shingle
any part of the roof on the south aspect.</p>

<p><i>Materials for glazed frames.</i>&mdash;Carolina pine is the
best material for the wood work, as it is not so subject
to decay from moisture and heat as the other kinds of
pine wood. The frames or sashes can be of any convenient
length, not exceeding ten feet, and about three
and a half or four feet wide, divided so as they can be
glazed with glass six inches wide.</p>

<p><i>Of glazing.</i> The pieces of glass should not exceed
six inches by ten, the lappings about one quarter of an
inch. The frames ought to have one coat of paint
previous to glazing, and all under the glass puttied.
Some prefer the lappings to be puttied also. It is our
opinion that in a Hot-house these should not be puttied,
but in the Green-house the closer they can be made
the better.</p>

<p><i>Of Shutters.</i>&mdash;These should be made of half inch
white pine, and bound on both ends and sides, having
a cross piece in the middle of the same. They ought
to be painted once in three years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>


<h4>ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GREEN-HOUSE.</h4>

<p>In many respects, the construction of the Green*-house
will be the same as the Hot-house, but might
be made much more an ornamental object, and could
be erected contiguous to the mansion-house, with large
folding doors to open at pleasure, and be connected
with the drawing-room or parlour. The extent may
vary according to the collection to be cultivated.</p>

<p>It was formerly the practice to build these houses
with glass only in front, and even to introduce between
the windows strong piers of brick or stone: but this is
now abolished, and has given way to a light and ornamental
style, by which cheerfulness and the desired
utility are better consulted. There should be conveniences
in the back part of the house, that a free current
of air may be obtained whenever desired, which is an
essential point. Two or three dark windows will answer
the purpose well, if made to open and shut at
pleasure.</p>


<h4>ON LAYING OUT A FLOWER-GARDEN.</h4>


<p><i>Soil, situation, and ground&mdash;Plan.</i>&mdash;A soil of common
good qualities, moderately light and mellow, will grow
most of the hardy herbaceous flowers, and the ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>green
and deciduous ornamental shrubs. The situation
should not be so low as to be damp and wet, or
liable to be inundated, neither so high as to be scorched
or dried up by the sun. The surface should be
level or moderately sloping, and if unequal, parts of
it may be transposed, so as to make gentle inclinations.
In regard to form, it may be of any shape, and must be
often adapted to local circumstances; but if it is so
circumscribed that the eye can at once embrace the
whole, it is desirable that it should be of some regular
figure.</p>

<p><i>Of Fences.</i>&mdash;Where domestic buildings do not serve
as a boundary, either paling or hedge-fence has to be
resorted to: we would prefer the former on the north
or north-west side, which is of great advantage as a
screen from cutting winds. For hedge-fences and their
kinds, see <a href="#Page_210">page 210</a>. The exotic observed there is
<i>Th&ugrave;ja orient&agrave;lis</i>, Chinese Arbor-vit&aelig;. The internal
fences for shade or shelter to particular compartments,
or to afford a diversity of aspect, may be made of <i>Sweetbriar</i>,
<i>hardy China roses</i>, <i>Pyrus</i>, <i>red</i> and <i>white</i>, with a few
others of a similar nature, all of which must be attended
to, to have them in neat order.</p>

<p><i>Style of dividing the Ground.</i>&mdash;This may vary with the
extent of the ground, and the object of the cultivator.</p>

<p>The principal designs may be delineated, but one to
answer every view and situation, we pretend not to
give. In the first place, carry a boundary walk all
round the garden, on one or two sides of which it may
be straight, the others winding. The intersecting walks
should (almost imperceptibly) lead to a centre, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
to cross at right angles, or to have parallel lines, as if
divided or laid down by a mathematical scale, which is
too formal for the diversification of nature. All
walks through these pleasure departments should be
winding and enlivening, not continuing any length in
one direction.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> The continuous view of a straight
walk is dull and monotonous. The divisions should be
highest about the centre, that whatever is planted
therein may have effect; and to make a Flower-garden
fully interesting, and render it a source of natural information,
where free scope might at all times be afforded
to employ the leisure hours in mental improvement,
there should be a good system of arrangement adopted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_K_11" id="Footnote_K_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_K_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> Since writing the above we have seen the Flower-garden of J. B. Smith, Esq.
and consider it a beautiful specimen, finely illustrating the taste of that gentleman.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Linnean</i> system is the most easily acquired. A
small compartment laid out in beds might contain
plants of all the twenty-four <i>classes</i>, and a few of all the
hardy <i>orders</i>, which do not exceed one hundred. Or to
have their natural characters more assimilated, the
<i>Jussieuean</i> system could be carried into effect by laying
down a grass plat, to any extent above one quarter of
an acre, and cut therein small figures to contain the
natural families, which of hardy plants we do not suppose
would exceed one hundred and fifty. The difficulties
of this arrangement are, that many of the characters
are imperfectly known even to the most
scientific. <i>Mr. John Lindley</i> has given additional light
on the subject by his last publication. All the large
divisions should be intersected by small allies, or paths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
about one and a half or two feet wide. These may be
at right angles, or parallel, for convenience and order,
in making beds, &amp;c. for the various Dutch roots and
other flowers. Patches or plats of grass studded with
shrubs, deciduous and evergreen, are indispensable,
and perhaps one or two grass walks.</p>

<p><i>Of Walks.</i>&mdash;These should have five or six inches of
lime and brick rubbish, or broken stone in the bottom,
covered with small pebbles, and firmly rolled with a heavy
roller, over which lay two or three inches of fine gravel,
giving the whole a complete rolling. Walks made on
this method will stand well, and be always dry and
firm. With regard to breadth, they must be made according
to the extent of ground, and vary from three
to thirty feet; from four to eight feet is generally
adopted.</p>

<p>REMARKS ON THE NATURE OF SOILS USED IN THE ABOVE TABLE.</p>

<p><i>Savanna soil</i>&mdash;is of a dark colour, with a large portion of white sand incorporated
with it, and is found frequently in New Jersey. A mixture of two-thirds
black earth from the woods, and one-third of pure white sand, will be similar to
it, and may be used as a substitute, but is not exactly of the same nature.</p>

<p><i>Loam</i>&mdash;is of a light brown colour, and is that from old pastures or commons, which
should lie one year, and be frequently turned before using. It ought not to be
from a clay bottom.</p>

<p><i>Leaf mould</i>&mdash;is that which is to be found on the surface of the ground in woods,
and is the decomposed leaves. It may be termed nearly of first rate importance
in vegetation.</p>

<p><i>Sand</i>&mdash;is a substance that is generally known, and that which is found on the surface
is decidedly the best. If it is from a pit, it must be spread out, and frequently
turned, that it may assimilate with the atmosphere before using;&mdash;four months
will be sufficient.</p>

<p><i>Manure</i>&mdash;before using, must be decomposed to very fine particles. It will require
two years, during which time it must be often turned, and the longer it lays it
will be the finer and more congenial.</p>

<p class="center"><b>EXOTIC NURSERYMEN AND FLORISTS</b>,</p>

<p>Respectfully inform their friends and the public generally, that in addition
to the Garden in Thirteenth-street, they have purchased the Nursery Grounds,
Green-Houses, &amp;c., established by the late B. M'Mahon, Esq., on the township
line, near the Germantown road, about three miles from the city, where the propagation
and cultivation of Ornamental Trees, Shrubs, Plants, and Flowers, will
hereafter be extensively carried on, and improved in accordance to the increasing
demand.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth-street Garden will be appropriated as a repository for the sale
of plants and the receiving of orders.</p>

<p>A splendid collection of Camellia Japonica, containing the most approved and
distinct varieties; also a very large selection of the most esteemed and beautiful
Roses. Their Dahlias were selected by R. Buist, last year, from the finest collection
in England, together with many Ornamental and other Plants not surpassed
for extent in the Union.</p>

<p>Orders at either of the establishments, or per post, will be duly received and
punctually attended to.</p>
